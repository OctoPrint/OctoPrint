class TemplatePlugin(OctoPrintPlugin, ReloadNeedingPlugin):
	"""
	Using the ``TemplatePlugin`` mixin plugins may inject their own components into the OctoPrint web interface.

	Currently OctoPrint supports the following types of injections out of the box:

	Navbar
	   The right part of the navigation bar located at the top of the UI can be enriched with additional links. Note that
	   with the current implementation, plugins will always be located *to the left* of the existing links.

	   The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_navbar.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_navbar.jinja2``) unless
	   overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	   The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content. The
	   wrapper structure will have all additional classes and styles applied as specified via the configuration supplied
	   through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	Sidebar
	   The left side bar containing Connection, State and Files sections can be enriched with additional sections. Note
	   that with the current implementations, plugins will always be located *beneath* the existing sections.

	   The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_sidebar.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_sidebar.jinja2``) unless
	   overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	   The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content. The
	   wrapper divs for both the whole box as well as the content pane will have all additional classes and styles applied
	   as specified via the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	Tabs
	   The available tabs of the main part of the interface may be extended with additional tabs originating from within
	   plugins. Note that with the current implementation, plugins will always be located *to the right* of the existing
	   tabs.

	   The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_tab.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_tab.jinja2``) unless
	   overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	   The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content. The
	   wrapper div and the link in the navigation will have the additional classes and styles applied as specified via the
	   configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	Settings
	   Plugins may inject a dialog into the existing settings view. Note that with the current implementations, plugins
	   will always be listed beneath the "Plugins" header in the settings link list, ordered alphabetically after
	   their displayed name.

	   The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_settings.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_settings.jinja2``) unless
	   overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	   The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content. The
	   wrapper div and the link in the navigation will have the additional classes and styles applied as defined via the
	   supplied configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	Wizards
	   Plugins may define wizard dialogs to display to the user if necessary (e.g. in case of missing information that
	   needs to be queried from the user to make the plugin work). Note that with the current implementations, all
	   wizard dialogs will be will always be sorted by their ``mandatory`` attribute (which defaults to ``False``) and then
	   alphabetically by their ``name``. Hence, mandatory wizard steps will come first, sorted alphabetically, then the
	   optional steps will follow, also alphabetically. A wizard dialog provided through a plugin will only be displayed
	   if the plugin reports the wizard as being required through :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.WizardPlugin.is_wizard_required`.
	   Please also refer to the :class:`~octoprint.plugin.WizardPlugin` mixin for further details on this.

	   The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_wizard.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_wizard.jinja2``) unless
	   overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	   The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content.
	   The wrapper div and the link in the wizard navigation will have the additional classes and styles applied as defined
	   via the supplied configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

	   .. note::

	      A note about ``mandatory`` wizard steps: In the current implementation, marking a wizard step as
	      mandatory will *only* make it styled accordingly. It is the task of the :ref:`view model <sec-plugins-viewmodels>`
	      to actually prevent the user from skipping the dialog by implementing the ``onWizardTabChange``
	      callback and returning ``false`` there if it is detected that the user hasn't yet filled in the
	      wizard step.

	Generic
	   Plugins may also inject arbitrary templates into the page of the web interface itself, e.g. in order to
	   add overlays or dialogs to be called from within the plugin's javascript code.

	You can find an example for a simple plugin which injects navbar, tab and settings content into the interface in
	the "helloworld" plugin in OctoPrint's :ref:`Plugin Tutorial <sec-plugins-gettingstarted>`.

	Plugins may replace existing components, see the ``replaces`` keyword in the template configurations returned by
	:meth:`.get_template_configs` below. Note that if a plugin replaces a core component, it is the plugin's
	responsibility to ensure that all core functionality is still maintained.

	Plugins can also add additional template types by implementing the :ref:`octoprint.ui.web.templatetypes <sec-plugins-hook-ui-web-templatetypes>` hook.

	def get_template_configs(self):
		"""
		Allows configuration of injected navbar, sidebar, tab and settings templates (and also additional templates of
		types specified by plugins through the :ref:`octoprint.ui.web.templatetypes <sec-plugins-hook-ui-web-templatetypes>` hook).
		Should be a list containing one configuration object per template to inject. Each configuration object is
		represented by a dictionary which may contain the following keys:

		.. list-table::
		   :widths: 5 95

		   * - type
		     - The template type the configuration is targeting. Possible values here are ``navbar``, ``sidebar``,
		       ``tab``, ``settings`` and ``generic``. Mandatory.
		   * - name
		     - The name of the component, if not set the name of the plugin will be used. The name will be visible at
		       a location depending on the ``type``:

		         * ``navbar``: unused
		         * ``sidebar``: sidebar heading
		         * ``tab``: tab heading
		         * ``settings``: settings link
		         * ``generic``: unused

		   * - template
		     - Name of the template to inject, default value depends on the ``type``:

		         * ``navbar``: ``<plugin identifier>_navbar.jinja2``
		         * ``sidebar``: ``<plugin identifier>_sidebar.jinja2``
		         * ``tab``: ``<plugin identifier>_tab.jinja2``
		         * ``settings``: ``<plugin identifier>_settings.jinja2``
		         * ``generic``: ``<plugin identifier>.jinja2``

		   * - suffix
		     - Suffix to attach to the component identifier and the div identifier of the injected template. Will be
		       ``_<index>`` if not provided and not the first template of the type, with ``index`` counting from 1 and
		       increasing for each template of the same type.

		       Example: If your plugin with identifier ``myplugin`` defines two tab components like this:

		       .. code-block:: python

		          return [
		              dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_first_tab.jinja2"),
		              dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_second_tab.jinja2")
		          ]

		       then the first tab will have the component identifier ``plugin_myplugin`` and the second one will have
		       the component identifier ``plugin_myplugin_2`` (the generated divs will be ``tab_plugin_myplugin`` and
		       ``tab_plugin_myplugin_2`` accordingly). Notice that the first tab is *not* called ``plugin_myplugin_1`` --
		       as stated above while the ``index`` used as default suffix starts counting at 1, it will not be applied
		       for the first component of a given type.

		       If on the other hand your plugin's definition looks like this:

		       .. code-block:: python

		          return [
		              dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_first_tab_jinja2", suffix="_1st"),
		              dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_second_tab_jinja2", suffix="_2nd")
		          ]

		       then the generated component identifier will be ``plugin_myplugin_1st`` and ``plugin_myplugin_2nd``
		       (and the divs will be ``tab_plugin_myplugin_1st`` and ``tab_plugin_myplugin_2nd``).

		   * - div
		     - Id for the div containing the component. If not provided, defaults to ``<type>_plugin_<plugin identifier>`` plus
		       the ``suffix`` if provided or required.
		   * - replaces
		     - Id of the component this one replaces, might be either one of the core components or a component
		       provided by another plugin. A list of the core component identifiers can be found
		       :ref:`in the configuration documentation <sec-configuration-config_yaml-appearance>`. The identifiers of
		       other plugin components always follow the format described above.
		   * - custom_bindings
		     - A boolean value indicating whether the default view model should be bound to the component (``false``)
		       or if a custom binding will be used by the plugin (``true``, default).
		   * - data_bind
		     - Additional knockout data bindings to apply to the component, can be used to add further behaviour to
		       the container based on internal state if necessary.
		   * - classes
		     - Additional classes to apply to the component, as a list of individual classes
		       (e.g. ``classes=["myclass", "myotherclass"]``) which will be joined into the correct format by the template engine.
		   * - styles
		     - Additional CSS styles to apply to the component, as a list of individual declarations
		       (e.g. ``styles=["color: red", "display: block"]``) which will be joined into the correct format by the template
		       engine.

		Further keys to be included in the dictionary depend on the type:

		``sidebar`` type

		   .. list-table::
		      :widths: 5 95

		      * - icon
		        - Icon to use for the sidebar header, should be the name of a Font Awesome icon without the leading ``icon-`` part.
		      * - template_header
		        - Additional template to include in the head section of the sidebar item. For an example of this, see the additional
		          options included in the "Files" section.
		      * - classes_wrapper
		        - Like ``classes`` but only applied to the whole wrapper around the sidebar box.
		      * - classes_content
		        - Like ``classes`` but only applied to the content pane itself.
		      * - styles_wrapper
		        - Like ``styles`` but only applied to the whole wrapper around the sidebar box.
		      * - styles_content
		        - Like ``styles`` but only applied to the content pane itself

		``tab`` type and ``settings`` type

		   .. list-table::
		      :widths: 5 95

		      * - classes_link
		        - Like ``classes`` but only applied to the link in the navigation.
		      * - classes_content
		        - Like ``classes`` but only applied to the content pane itself.
		      * - styles_link
		        - Like ``styles`` but only applied to the link in the navigation.
		      * - styles_content
		        - Like ``styles`` but only applied to the content pane itself.

		``wizard`` type

		   .. list-table::
		      :widths: 5 95

		      * - mandatory
		        - Whether the wizard step is mandatory (True) or not (False). Optional,
		          defaults to False. If set to True, OctoPrint will sort visually mark
		          the step as mandatory in the UI (bold in the navigation and a little
		          alert) and also sort it into the first half.

		.. note::

		   As already outlined above, each template type has a default template name (i.e. the default navbar template
		   of a plugin is called ``<plugin identifier>_navbar.jinja2``), which may be overridden using the template configuration.
		   If a plugin needs to include more than one template of a given type, it needs to provide an entry for each of
		   those, since the implicit default template will only be included automatically if no other templates of that
		   type are defined.

		   Example: If you have a plugin that injects two tab components, one defined in the template file
		   ``myplugin_tab.jinja2`` (the default template) and one in the template ``myplugin_othertab.jinja2``, you
		   might be tempted to just return the following configuration since one your templates is named by the default
		   template name:

		   .. code-block:: python

		      return [
		          dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_othertab.jinja2")
		      ]

		   This will only include the tab defined in ``myplugin_othertab.jinja2`` though, ``myplugin_tab.jinja2`` will
		   not be included automatically since the presence of a defintion for the ``tab`` type overrides the automatic
		   injection of the default template. You'll have to include it explicitely:

		   .. code-block:: python

		      return [
		          dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_tab.jinja2"),
		          dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_othertab.jinja2")
		      ]

		:return list: a list containing the configuration options for the plugin's injected templates

		"""
		Defines additional template variables to include into the template renderer. Variable names will be prefixed
		with ``plugin_<plugin identifier>_``.

		:return dict: a dictionary containing any additional template variables to include in the renderer
		"""
		return dict()

	def get_template_folder(self):
		"""

		return os.path.join(self._basefolder, "templates")


class WizardPlugin(OctoPrintPlugin, ReloadNeedingPlugin):
	"""
	The ``WizardPlugin`` mixin allows plugins to report to OctoPrint whether
	the ``wizard`` templates they define via the :class:`~octoprint.plugin.TemplatePlugin`
	should be displayed to the user, what details to provide to their respective
	wizard frontend components and what to do when the wizard is finished
	by the user.

	OctoPrint will only display such wizard dialogs to the user which belong
	to plugins that

	  * report ``True`` in their :func:`is_wizard_required` method and
	  * have not yet been shown to the user in the version currently being reported
	    by the :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.WizardPlugin.get_wizard_version` method

	Example: If a plugin with the identifier ``myplugin`` has a specific
	setting ``some_key`` it needs to have filled by the user in order to be
	able to work at all, it would probably test for that setting's value in
	the :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.WizardPlugin.is_wizard_required` method and
	return ``True`` if the value is unset:

	.. code-block:: python

	   class MyPlugin(octoprint.plugin.SettingsPlugin,
	                  octoprint.plugin.TemplatePlugin,
	                  octoprint.plugin.WizardPlugin):

	       def get_default_settings(self):
	           return dict(some_key=None)

	       def is_wizard_required(self):
	           return self._settings.get(["some_key"]) is None

	OctoPrint will then display the wizard dialog provided by the plugin through
	the :class:`TemplatePlugin` mixin. Once the user finishes the wizard on the
	frontend, OctoPrint will store that it already showed the wizard of ``myplugin``
	in the version reported by :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.WizardPlugin.get_wizard_version`
	- here ``None`` since that is the default value returned by that function
	and the plugin did not override it.

	If the plugin in a later version needs another setting from the user in order
	to function, it will also need to change the reported version in order to
	have OctoPrint reshow the dialog. E.g.

	.. code-block:: python

	   class MyPlugin(octoprint.plugin.SettingsPlugin,

class SimpleApiPlugin(OctoPrintPlugin):
	"""
	Utilizing the ``SimpleApiPlugin`` mixin plugins may implement a simple API based around one GET resource and one
	resource accepting JSON commands POSTed to it. This is the easy alternative for plugin's which don't need the
	full power of a `Flask Blueprint <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/blueprints/>`_ that the :class:`BlueprintPlugin`
	mixin offers.

	Use this mixin if all you need to do is return some kind of dynamic data to your plugin from the backend
	and/or want to react to simple commands which boil down to a type of command and a couple of flat parameters
	supplied with it.

	The simple API constructed by OctoPrint for you will be made available under ``/api/plugin/<plugin identifier>/``.
	OctoPrint will do some preliminary request validation for your defined commands, making sure the request body is in
	the correct format (content type must be JSON) and contains all obligatory parameters for your command.

	Let's take a look at a small example for such a simple API and how you would go about calling it.

	Take this example of a plugin registered under plugin identifier ``mysimpleapiplugin``:

	.. code-block:: python
	   :linenos:

	   import octoprint.plugin

	   import flask

	   class MySimpleApiPlugin(octoprint.plugin.SimpleApiPlugin):
	       def get_api_commands(self):
	           return dict(
	               command1=[],
	               command2=["some_parameter"]
	           )

	       def on_api_command(self, command, data):
	           import flask
	           if command == "command1":
	               parameter = "unset"
	               if "parameter" in data:
	                   parameter = "set"
	               self._logger.info("command1 called, parameter is {parameter}".format(**locals()))
	           elif command == "command2":
	               self._logger.info("command2 called, some_parameter is {some_parameter}".format(**data))

	       def on_api_get(self, request):
	           return flask.jsonify(foo="bar")

	   __plugin_implementation__ = MySimpleApiPlugin()

	Our plugin defines two commands, ``command1`` with no mandatory parameters and ``command2`` with one
	mandatory parameter ``some_parameter``.

	``command1`` can also accept an optional parameter ``parameter``, and will log whether
	that parameter was set or unset. ``command2`` will log the content of the mandatory ``some_parameter`` parameter.

	A valid POST request for ``command2`` sent to ``/api/plugin/mysimpleapiplugin`` would look like this:

	.. sourcecode:: http

	   POST /api/plugin/mysimpleapiplugin HTTP/1.1
	   Host: example.com
	   Content-Type: application/json
	   X-Api-Key: abcdef...

	   {
	     "command": "command2",
	     "some_parameter": "some_value",
	     "some_optional_parameter": 2342
	   }

	which would produce a response like this:

	.. sourcecode:: http

	   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

	and print something like this line to ``octoprint.log``::

	   2015-02-12 17:40:21,140 - octoprint.plugins.mysimpleapiplugin - INFO - command2 called, some_parameter is some_value

	A GET request on our plugin's simple API resource will only return a JSON document like this:

	.. sourcecode:: http

	   HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
	   Content-Type: application/json

	   {
	     "foo": "bar"
	   }

class BlueprintPlugin(OctoPrintPlugin, RestartNeedingPlugin):
	"""
	The ``BlueprintPlugin`` mixin allows plugins to define their own full fledged endpoints for whatever purpose,
	be it a more sophisticated API than what is possible via the :class:`SimpleApiPlugin` or a custom web frontend.

	The mechanism at work here is `Flask's <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ own `Blueprint mechanism <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/blueprints/>`_.

	The mixin automatically creates a blueprint for you that will be registered under ``/plugin/<plugin identifier>/``.
	All you need to do is decorate all of your view functions with the :func:`route` decorator,
	which behaves exactly the same like Flask's regular ``route`` decorators. Example:

	.. code-block:: python
	   :linenos:

	   import octoprint.plugin
	   import flask

	   class MyBlueprintPlugin(octoprint.plugin.BlueprintPlugin):
	       @octoprint.plugin.BlueprintPlugin.route("/echo", methods=["GET"])

	               return flask.make_response("Expected a text to echo back.", 400)
	           return flask.request.values["text"]

	   __plugin_implementation__ = MyBlueprintPlugin()

	Your blueprint will be published by OctoPrint under the base URL ``/plugin/<plugin identifier>/``, so the above
	example of a plugin with the identifier "myblueprintplugin" would be reachable under
	``/plugin/myblueprintplugin/echo``.

	Just like with regular blueprints you'll be able to create URLs via ``url_for``, just use the prefix
	``plugin.<plugin identifier>.<method_name>``, e.g.:

	.. code-block:: python

	   flask.url_for("plugin.myblueprintplugin.myEcho") # will return "/plugin/myblueprintplugin/echo"

class SettingsPlugin(OctoPrintPlugin):
	"""
	Including the ``SettingsPlugin`` mixin allows plugins to store and retrieve their own settings within OctoPrint's
	configuration.

	Plugins including the mixing will get injected an additional property ``self._settings`` which is an instance of
	:class:`PluginSettingsManager` already properly initialized for use by the plugin. In order for the manager to
	know about the available settings structure and default values upon initialization, implementing plugins will need
	to provide a dictionary with the plugin's default settings through overriding the method :func:`get_settings_defaults`.
	The defined structure will then be available to access through the settings manager available as ``self._settings``.

	If your plugin needs to react to the change of specific configuration values on the fly, e.g. to adjust the log level
	of a logger when the user changes a corresponding flag via the settings dialog, you can override the
	:func:`on_settings_save` method and wrap the call to the implementation from the parent class with retrieval of the
	old and the new value and react accordingly.

	.. code-block:: python

	   import octoprint.plugin

	   class MySettingsPlugin(octoprint.plugin.SettingsPlugin, octoprint.plugin.StartupPlugin):
	       def get_settings_defaults(self):

	                   some_flag=True

	       def on_after_startup(self):
	           some_setting = self._settings.get(["some_setting"])

		If provided, the ``profile_path`` is guaranteed by OctoPrint to be a serialized slicing profile created through the slicing
		plugin's own :func:`save_slicer_profile` method.

		If provided, ``position`` will be a ``dict`` containing and ``x`` and a ``y`` key, indicating the position
		the center of the model on the print bed should have in the final sliced machine code. If not provided, slicer
		implementations should place the model in the center of the print bed.

		``on_progress`` will be a callback which expects an additional keyword argument ``_progress`` with the current
		slicing progress which - if progress reporting is supported - the slicing plugin should call like the following:

		.. code-block:: python

		   if on_progress is not None:
		       if on_progress_args is None:
		           on_progress_args = ()
		       if on_progress_kwargs is None:
		           on_progress_kwargs = dict()

		       on_progress_kwargs["_progress"] = your_plugins_slicing_progress
		       on_progress(*on_progress_args, **on_progress_kwargs)

		Please note that both ``on_progress_args`` and ``on_progress_kwargs`` as supplied by OctoPrint might be ``None``,
		so always make sure to initialize those values to sane defaults like depicted above before invoking the callback.

		In order to support external cancellation of an ongoing slicing job via :func:`cancel_slicing`, implementations
		should make sure to track the started jobs via the ``machinecode_path``, if provided.

		The method should return a 2-tuple consisting of a boolean ``flag`` indicating whether the slicing job was
		finished successfully (True) or not (False) and a ``result`` depending on the success of the slicing job.

		For jobs that finished successfully, ``result`` should be a :class:`dict` containing additional information
		about the slicing job under the following keys:

		_analysis
		    Analysis result of the generated machine code as returned by the slicer itself. This should match the
		    data structure described for the analysis queue of the matching maching code format, e.g.
		    :class:`~octoprint.filemanager.analysis.GcodeAnalysisQueue` for GCODE files.

		For jobs that did not finish successfully (but not due to being cancelled!), ``result`` should be a :class:`str`
		containing a human readable reason for the error.

		If the job gets cancelled, a :class:`~octoprint.slicing.SlicingCancelled` exception should be raised.

		Returns:
		    tuple: A 2-tuple (boolean, object) as outlined above.

		Raises:
		    SlicingCancelled: The slicing job was cancelled (via :meth:`cancel_slicing`).
