    Using the ``TemplatePlugin`` mixin plugins may inject their own components into the OctoPrint web interface.

    Currently OctoPrint supports the following types of injections out of the box:

    Navbar
       The right part of the navigation bar located at the top of the UI can be enriched with additional links. Note that
       with the current implementation, plugins will always be located *to the left* of the existing links.

       The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_navbar.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_navbar.jinja2``) unless
       overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

       The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content. The
       wrapper structure will have all additional classes and styles applied as specified via the configuration supplied
       through :func:`get_template_configs`.

    Sidebar
       The left side bar containing Connection, State and Files sections can be enriched with additional sections. Note
       that with the current implementations, plugins will always be located *beneath* the existing sections.

       The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_sidebar.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_sidebar.jinja2``) unless
       overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

       The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content. The
       wrapper divs for both the whole box as well as the content pane will have all additional classes and styles applied
       as specified via the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

    Tabs
       The available tabs of the main part of the interface may be extended with additional tabs originating from within
       plugins. Note that with the current implementation, plugins will always be located *to the right* of the existing
       tabs.

       The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_tab.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_tab.jinja2``) unless
       overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

       The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content. The
       wrapper div and the link in the navigation will have the additional classes and styles applied as specified via the
       configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

    Settings
       Plugins may inject a dialog into the existing settings view. Note that with the current implementation, plugins
       will always be listed beneath the "Plugins" header in the settings link list, ordered alphabetically after
       their displayed name.

       The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_settings.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_settings.jinja2``) unless
       overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

       The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content. The
       wrapper div and the link in the navigation will have the additional classes and styles applied as defined via the
       configuration through :func:`get_template_configs`.

    Wizards
       Plugins may define wizard dialogs to display to the user if necessary (e.g. in case of missing information that
       needs to be queried from the user to make the plugin work). Note that with the current implementation, all
       wizard dialogs will be will always be sorted by their ``mandatory`` attribute (which defaults to ``False``) and then
       alphabetically by their ``name``. Hence, mandatory wizard steps will come first, sorted alphabetically, then the
       optional steps will follow, also alphabetically. A wizard dialog provided through a plugin will only be displayed
       if the plugin reports the wizard as being required through :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.WizardPlugin.is_wizard_required`.
       Please also refer to the :class:`~octoprint.plugin.WizardPlugin` mixin for further details on this.

       The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_wizard.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_wizard.jinja2``) unless
       overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

       The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content.
       The wrapper div and the link in the wizard navigation will have the additional classes and styles applied as defined
       via the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

       .. note::

          A note about ``mandatory`` wizard steps: In the current implementation, marking a wizard step as
          mandatory will *only* make it styled accordingly. It is the task of the :ref:`view model <sec-plugins-viewmodels>`
          to actually prevent the user from skipping the dialog by implementing the ``onWizardTabChange``
          callback and returning ``false`` there if it is detected that the user hasn't yet filled in the
          wizard step.

       .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

    About
       Plugins may define additional panels into OctoPrint's "About" dialog. Note that with the current implementation
       further about dialog panels will be sorted alphabetically by their name and sorted after the predefined ones.

       The included template must be called ``<plugin identifier>_about.jinja2`` (e.g. ``myplugin_about.jinja2``) unless
       overridden by the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

       The template will be already wrapped into the necessary structure, plugins just need to supply the pure content. The
       wrapped div and the link in the navigation will have the additional classes and styles applied as defined via
       the configuration supplied through :func:`get_template_configs`.

       .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

    Generic
       Plugins may also inject arbitrary templates into the page of the web interface itself, e.g. in order to
       add overlays or dialogs to be called from within the plugin's JavaScript code.

    You can find an example for a simple plugin which injects navbar, tab and settings content into the interface in
    the "helloworld" plugin in OctoPrint's :ref:`Plugin Tutorial <sec-plugins-gettingstarted>`.

    Plugins may replace existing components, see the ``replaces`` keyword in the template configurations returned by
    :meth:`.get_template_configs` below. Note that if a plugin replaces a core component, it is the plugin's
    responsibility to ensure that all core functionality is still maintained.

    Plugins can also add additional template types by implementing the :ref:`octoprint.ui.web.templatetypes <sec-plugins-hook-ui-web-templatetypes>` hook.

        .. list-table::
           :widths: 5 95

           * - type
             - The template type the configuration is targeting. Possible values here are ``navbar``, ``sidebar``,
               ``tab``, ``settings`` and ``generic``. Mandatory.
           * - name
             - The name of the component, if not set the name of the plugin will be used. The name will be visible at
               a location depending on the ``type``:

                 * ``navbar``: unused
                 * ``sidebar``: sidebar heading
                 * ``tab``: tab heading
                 * ``settings``: settings link
                 * ``wizard``: wizard link
                 * ``about``: about link
                 * ``generic``: unused

           * - template
             - Name of the template to inject, default value depends on the ``type``:

                 * ``navbar``: ``<plugin identifier>_navbar.jinja2``
                 * ``sidebar``: ``<plugin identifier>_sidebar.jinja2``
                 * ``tab``: ``<plugin identifier>_tab.jinja2``
                 * ``settings``: ``<plugin identifier>_settings.jinja2``
                 * ``wizard``: ``<plugin identifier>_wizard.jinja2``
                 * ``about``: ``<plugin identifier>_about.jinja2``
                 * ``generic``: ``<plugin identifier>.jinja2``

           * - suffix
             - Suffix to attach to the component identifier and the div identifier of the injected template. Will be
               ``_<index>`` if not provided and not the first template of the type, with ``index`` counting from 1 and
               increasing for each template of the same type.

               Example: If your plugin with identifier ``myplugin`` defines two tab components like this:

               .. code-block:: python

                  return [
                      dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_first_tab.jinja2"),
                      dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_second_tab.jinja2")
                  ]

               then the first tab will have the component identifier ``plugin_myplugin`` and the second one will have
               the component identifier ``plugin_myplugin_2`` (the generated divs will be ``tab_plugin_myplugin`` and
               ``tab_plugin_myplugin_2`` accordingly). Notice that the first tab is *not* called ``plugin_myplugin_1`` --
               as stated above while the ``index`` used as default suffix starts counting at 1, it will not be applied
               for the first component of a given type.

               If on the other hand your plugin's definition looks like this:

               .. code-block:: python

                  return [
                      dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_first_tab_jinja2", suffix="_1st"),
                      dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_second_tab_jinja2", suffix="_2nd")
                  ]

               then the generated component identifier will be ``plugin_myplugin_1st`` and ``plugin_myplugin_2nd``
               (and the divs will be ``tab_plugin_myplugin_1st`` and ``tab_plugin_myplugin_2nd``).

           * - div
             - Id for the div containing the component. If not provided, defaults to ``<type>_plugin_<plugin identifier>`` plus
               the ``suffix`` if provided or required.
           * - replaces
             - Id of the component this one replaces, might be either one of the core components or a component
               provided by another plugin. A list of the core component identifiers can be found
               :ref:`in the configuration documentation <sec-configuration-config_yaml-appearance>`. The identifiers of
               other plugin components always follow the format described above.
           * - custom_bindings
             - A boolean value indicating whether the default view model should be bound to the component (``false``)
               or if a custom binding will be used by the plugin (``true``, default).
           * - data_bind
             - Additional knockout data bindings to apply to the component, can be used to add further behaviour to
               the container based on internal state if necessary.
           * - classes
             - Additional classes to apply to the component, as a list of individual classes
               (e.g. ``classes=["myclass", "myotherclass"]``) which will be joined into the correct format by the template engine.
           * - styles
             - Additional CSS styles to apply to the component, as a list of individual declarations
               (e.g. ``styles=["color: red", "display: block"]``) which will be joined into the correct format by the template
               engine.

        Further keys to be included in the dictionary depend on the type:

        ``sidebar`` type

           .. list-table::
              :widths: 5 95

              * - icon
                - Icon to use for the sidebar header, should be the name of a Font Awesome icon without the leading ``icon-`` part.
              * - template_header
                - Additional template to include in the head section of the sidebar item. For an example of this, see the additional
                  options included in the "Files" section.
              * - classes_wrapper
                - Like ``classes`` but only applied to the whole wrapper around the sidebar box.

                  the step as mandatory in the UI (bold in the navigation and a little
                  alert) and also sort it into the first half.

        .. note::

           As already outlined above, each template type has a default template name (i.e. the default navbar template
           of a plugin is called ``<plugin identifier>_navbar.jinja2``), which may be overridden using the template configuration.
           If a plugin needs to include more than one template of a given type, it needs to provide an entry for each of
           those, since the implicit default template will only be included automatically if no other templates of that
           type are defined.

           Example: If you have a plugin that injects two tab components, one defined in the template file
           ``myplugin_tab.jinja2`` (the default template) and one in the template ``myplugin_othertab.jinja2``, you
           might be tempted to just return the following configuration since one your templates is named by the default
           template name:

           .. code-block:: python

              return [
                  dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_othertab.jinja2")
              ]

           This will only include the tab defined in ``myplugin_othertab.jinja2`` though, ``myplugin_tab.jinja2`` will
           not be included automatically since the presence of a definition for the ``tab`` type overrides the automatic
           injection of the default template. You'll have to include it explicitly:

           .. code-block:: python

              return [
                  dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_tab.jinja2"),
                  dict(type="tab", template="myplugin_othertab.jinja2")
              ]

        return os.path.join(self._basefolder, "templates")


class UiPlugin(OctoPrintPlugin, SortablePlugin):
    """
    The ``UiPlugin`` mixin allows plugins to completely replace the UI served
    by OctoPrint when requesting the main page hosted at `/`.

    OctoPrint will query whether your mixin implementation will handle a
    provided request by calling :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.UiPlugin.will_handle_ui` with the Flask
    `Request <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.Request>`_ object as
    parameter. If you plugin returns `True` here, OctoPrint will next call
    :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.UiPlugin.on_ui_render` with a few parameters like
    - again - the Flask Request object and the render keyword arguments as
    used by the default OctoPrint web interface. For more information see below.

    There are two methods used in order to allow for caching of the actual
    response sent to the client. Whatever a plugin implementation returns
    from the call to its :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.UiPlugin.on_ui_render` method
    will be cached server side. The cache will be emptied in case of explicit
    no-cache headers sent by the client, or if the ``_refresh`` query parameter
    on the request exists and is set to ``true``. To prevent caching of the
    response altogether, a plugin may set no-cache headers on the returned
    response as well.

    ``UiPlugin`` is a :class:`~octoprint.plugin.core.SortablePlugin` with a sorting context
    for :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.UiPlugin.will_handle_ui`. The first plugin to return ``True``
    for :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.UiPlugin.will_handle_ui` will be the one whose ui will be used,
    no further calls to :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.UiPlugin.on_ui_render` will be performed.

    If implementations want to serve custom templates in the :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.UiPlugin.on_ui_render`
    method it is recommended to also implement the :class:`~octoprint.plugin.TemplatePlugin`
    mixin.

    **Example**

    What follows is a very simple example that renders a different (non functional and
    only exemplary) UI if the requesting client has a UserAgent string hinting
    at it being a mobile device:

    .. onlineinclude:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OctoPrint/Plugin-Examples/master/dummy_mobile_ui/__init__.py
       :linenos:
       :tab-width: 4
       :caption: `dummy_mobile_ui/__init__.py <https://github.com/OctoPrint/Plugin-Examples/blob/master/dummy_mobile_ui/__init__.py>`_

    .. onlineinclude:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OctoPrint/Plugin-Examples/master/dummy_mobile_ui/templates/dummy_mobile_ui_index.jinja2
       :linenos:
       :tab-width: 4
       :caption: `dummy_mobile_ui/templates/dummy_mobile_ui_index.jinja2 <https://github.com/OctoPrint/Plugin-Examples/blob/master/dummy_mobile_ui/templates/dummy_mobile_ui_index.jinja2>`_

    Try installing the above plugin ``dummy_mobile_ui`` (also available in the
    `plugin examples repository <https://github.com/OctoPrint/Plugin-Examples/blob/master/dummy_mobile_ui>`_)
    into your OctoPrint instance. If you access it from a regular desktop browser,
    you should still see the default UI. However if you access it from a mobile
    device (make sure to not have that request the desktop version of pages!)
    you should see the very simple dummy page defined above.

    **Preemptive and Runtime Caching**

    OctoPrint will also cache your custom UI for you in its server side UI cache, making sure
    it only gets re-rendered if the request demands that (by having no-cache headers set) or if
    the cache gets invalidated otherwise.

    In order to be able to do that, the ``UiPlugin`` offers overriding some cache specific
    methods used for figuring out the source files whose modification time to use for cache invalidation
    as well as override possibilities for ETag and LastModified calculation. Additionally there are
    methods to allow persisting call parameters to allow for preemptively caching your UI during
    server startup (basically eager caching instead of lazily waiting for the first request).

    See below for details on this.

    OctoPrint will then display the wizard dialog provided by the plugin through
    the :class:`TemplatePlugin` mixin. Once the user finishes the wizard on the
    frontend, OctoPrint will store that it already showed the wizard of ``myplugin``
    in the version reported by :meth:`~octoprint.plugin.WizardPlugin.get_wizard_version`

    and the plugin did not override it.

    to function, it will also need to change the reported version in order to
    have OctoPrint reshow the dialog. E.g.

class SimpleApiPlugin(OctoPrintPlugin):
    """
    Utilizing the ``SimpleApiPlugin`` mixin plugins may implement a simple API based around one GET resource and one
    resource accepting JSON commands POSTed to it. This is the easy alternative for plugin's which don't need the
    full power of a `Flask Blueprint <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/blueprints/>`_ that the :class:`BlueprintPlugin`
    mixin offers.

    Use this mixin if all you need to do is return some kind of dynamic data to your plugin from the backend
    and/or want to react to simple commands which boil down to a type of command and a few flat parameters
    supplied with it.

    The simple API constructed by OctoPrint for you will be made available under ``/api/plugin/<plugin identifier>/``.
    OctoPrint will do some preliminary request validation for your defined commands, making sure the request body is in
    the correct format (content type must be JSON) and contains all obligatory parameters for your command.

    Let's take a look at a small example for such a simple API and how you would go about calling it.

    Take this example of a plugin registered under plugin identifier ``mysimpleapiplugin``:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       import octoprint.plugin

       import flask

       class MySimpleApiPlugin(octoprint.plugin.SimpleApiPlugin):
           def get_api_commands(self):
               return dict(
                   command1=[],
                   command2=["some_parameter"]
               )

           def on_api_command(self, command, data):
               import flask
               if command == "command1":
                   parameter = "unset"
                   if "parameter" in data:
                       parameter = "set"
                   self._logger.info("command1 called, parameter is {parameter}".format(**locals()))
               elif command == "command2":
                   self._logger.info("command2 called, some_parameter is {some_parameter}".format(**data))

           def on_api_get(self, request):
               return flask.jsonify(foo="bar")

       __plugin_implementation__ = MySimpleApiPlugin()

    Our plugin defines two commands, ``command1`` with no mandatory parameters and ``command2`` with one
    mandatory parameter ``some_parameter``.

    ``command1`` can also accept an optional parameter ``parameter``, and will log whether
    that parameter was set or unset. ``command2`` will log the content of the mandatory ``some_parameter`` parameter.

    A valid POST request for ``command2`` sent to ``/api/plugin/mysimpleapiplugin`` would look like this:

    .. sourcecode:: http

       POST /api/plugin/mysimpleapiplugin HTTP/1.1
       Host: example.com
       Content-Type: application/json
       X-Api-Key: abcdef...

       {
         "command": "command2",
         "some_parameter": "some_value",
         "some_optional_parameter": 2342
       }

    which would produce a response like this:

    .. sourcecode:: http

       HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

    and print something like this line to ``octoprint.log``::

       2015-02-12 17:40:21,140 - octoprint.plugins.mysimpleapiplugin - INFO - command2 called, some_parameter is some_value

    A GET request on our plugin's simple API resource will only return a JSON document like this:

    .. sourcecode:: http

       HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
       Content-Type: application/json

       {
         "foo": "bar"

    The ``BlueprintPlugin`` mixin allows plugins to define their own full fledged endpoints for whatever purpose,
    be it a more sophisticated API than what is possible via the :class:`SimpleApiPlugin` or a custom web frontend.

    The mechanism at work here is `Flask's <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ own `Blueprint mechanism <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/blueprints/>`_.

    The mixin automatically creates a blueprint for you that will be registered under ``/plugin/<plugin identifier>/``.
    All you need to do is decorate all of your view functions with the :func:`route` decorator,
    which behaves exactly the same like Flask's regular ``route`` decorators. Example:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       import octoprint.plugin
       import flask

       class MyBlueprintPlugin(octoprint.plugin.BlueprintPlugin):

               return flask.request.values["text"]

       __plugin_implementation__ = MyBlueprintPlugin()

    Your blueprint will be published by OctoPrint under the base URL ``/plugin/<plugin identifier>/``, so the above
    example of a plugin with the identifier "myblueprintplugin" would be reachable under
    ``/plugin/myblueprintplugin/echo``.

    Just like with regular blueprints you'll be able to create URLs via ``url_for``, just use the prefix
    ``plugin.<plugin identifier>.<method_name>``, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: python

       flask.url_for("plugin.myblueprintplugin.myEcho") # will return "/plugin/myblueprintplugin/echo"

    know about the available settings structure and default values upon initialization, implementing plugins will need
    to provide a dictionary with the plugin's default settings through overriding the method :func:`get_settings_defaults`.
    The defined structure will then be available to access through the settings manager available as ``self._settings``.

    If your plugin needs to react to the change of specific configuration values on the fly, e.g. to adjust the log level
    of a logger when the user changes a corresponding flag via the settings dialog, you can override the
    :func:`on_settings_save` method and wrap the call to the implementation from the parent class with retrieval of the
    old and the new value and react accordingly.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

       import octoprint.plugin

       class MySettingsPlugin(octoprint.plugin.SettingsPlugin, octoprint.plugin.StartupPlugin):
           def get_settings_defaults(self):
               return dict(
                   some_setting="foo",
                   some_value=23,
                   sub=dict(
                       some_flag=True
                   )
               )

           def on_settings_save(self, data):
               old_flag = self._settings.get_boolean(["sub", "some_flag"])

               octoprint.plugin.SettingsPlugin.on_settings_save(self, data)

               new_flag = self._settings.get_boolean(["sub", "some_flag"])
               if old_flag != new_flag:
                   self._logger.info("sub.some_flag changed from {old_flag} to {new_flag}".format(**locals()))

           def on_after_startup(self):
               some_setting = self._settings.get(["some_setting"])
               some_value = self._settings.get_int(["some_value"])
               some_flag = self._settings.get_boolean(["sub", "some_flag"])
               self._logger.info("some_setting = {some_setting}, some_value = {some_value}, sub.some_flag = {some_flag}".format(**locals())

       __plugin_implementation__ = MySettingsPlugin()

    Of course, you are always free to completely override both :func:`on_settings_load` and :func:`on_settings_save` if the
    default implementations do not fit your requirements.

            True if the slicer runs on the same device as OctoPrint, False otherwise. Slicers running on the same
            device will not be allowed to slice on systems with less than two CPU cores (or an unknown number) while a

            ``True`` if the slicer can report back slicing progress to OctoPrint ``False`` otherwise.
        source_file_types
            A list of file types this slicer supports as valid origin file types. These are file types as found in the

        the center of the model on the print bed should have in the final sliced machine code. If not provided, slicer
        implementations should place the model in the center of the print bed.

        ``on_progress`` will be a callback which expects an additional keyword argument ``_progress`` with the current
        slicing progress which - if progress reporting is supported - the slicing plugin should call like the following:

        Please note that both ``on_progress_args`` and ``on_progress_kwargs`` as supplied by OctoPrint might be ``None``,
        so always make sure to initialize those values to sane defaults like depicted above before invoking the callback.

        In order to support external cancellation of an ongoing slicing job via :func:`cancel_slicing`, implementations
        should make sure to track the started jobs via the ``machinecode_path``, if provided.

        The method should return a 2-tuple consisting of a boolean ``flag`` indicating whether the slicing job was
        finished successfully (True) or not (False) and a ``result`` depending on the success of the slicing job.

        For jobs that finished successfully, ``result`` should be a :class:`dict` containing additional information
        about the slicing job under the following keys:

        analysis
            Analysis result of the generated machine code as returned by the slicer itself. This should match the
            data structure described for the analysis queue of the matching machine code format, e.g.
            :class:`~octoprint.filemanager.analysis.GcodeAnalysisQueue` for GCODE files.

        For jobs that did not finish successfully (but not due to being cancelled!), ``result`` should be a :class:`str`
        containing a human readable reason for the error.

        If the job gets cancelled, a :class:`~octoprint.slicing.SlicingCancelled` exception should be raised.

        Returns:
            tuple: A 2-tuple (boolean, object) as outlined above.
