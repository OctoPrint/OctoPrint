"""
This module defines the interface for communicating with a connected printer.

The communication is in fact divided into two components, the :class:`PrinterInterface`, the
printer communication specific :class:`~octoprint.printer.connection.ConnectedPrinter`, and possibly deeper lying
communication components. However, plugins should only ever need to use the :class:`PrinterMixin` as the
abstracted version of the actual printer communication.

        Make absolutely sure that if you set this flag, you will always also unset it again. If you don't, the job will
