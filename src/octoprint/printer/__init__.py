"""
This module defines the interface for communicating with a connected printer.

The communication is in fact divided in two components, the :class:`PrinterInterface` and a deeper lying
communcation layer. However, plugins should only ever need to use the :class:`PrinterInterface` as the
abstracted version of the actual printer communiciation.
