<h3>{{ _('Software Update') }}</h3>

    By default, OctoPrint will update itself via <code>pip</code> to published releases. OctoPrint can
    also update itself via <code>git</code> to arbitrary development branches you need to check out manually.
    If you want to do that though it needs to know its checkout folder. You can configure that here.

</form>

    If you are running a release version of OctoPrint, leave at "Release" tracking. If you are running a different
    branch however, you should setup "Commit" tracking.
