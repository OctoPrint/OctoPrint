    Anonymous usage tracking provides valuable insights into how many instances running what versions of OctoPrint are out there,
    whether they are successfully completing print jobs and various other metrics including what browser versions are accessing them.

    By enabling it you help to identify problems with new releases and release candidates early on, and to better
    tailor OctoPrint's future development to actual use.
