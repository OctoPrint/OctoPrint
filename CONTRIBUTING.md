Issues, Tickets, however you may call them
------------------------------------------

- If you want to report a bug, **READ [How to file a bug report](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/How-to-file-a-bug-report)!** Tickets will be automatically checked if they comply with the requirements outlined in that wiki node! Other then what's written in there you don't have to do anything special with your ticket.
- If you want to post a **request** of any kind (feature request, documentation request, ...), **add [Request] to your issue's title!**
- If you need **support** with a problem of your installation (e.g. if you have problems getting the webcam to work), **add [Support] to your issue's title!**
- If you have a general **question**, **add [Question] to your issue's title!**
- If you have another reason for creating a ticket that doesn't fit any of the above categories, **add [Misc] to your issue's title!**

Pull Requests
-------------

1. Please create all pull requests against the `devel` branch.
2. Create **one pull request per feature/bug fix**.
3. Create a custom branch for your feature/bug fix and use that as base for your pull request. Pull requests directly against your version of `devel` will be closed.
4. In your pull request's description, state what your pull request is doing, as in, what feature does it implement, what bug does it fix.
