## Issues, Tickets, however you may call them

Please read the following instructions fully and follow them. You can
help the project tremendously this way: not only do you help the maintainers
to **address problems in a timely manner** but also keep it possible for them
to **fix bugs, add new and improve on existing functionality** instead of doing
nothing but ticket management.

![Ticket flow chart](https://i.imgur.com/cw19qHX.png)

- **[Read the FAQ](https://faq.octoprint.org)**
- If you want to report a **bug**, [read "How to file a bug report" below](#how-to-file-a-bug-report)
  and *[use the provided template](#what-should-i-include-in-a-ticket)*.
  You do not need to do anything else with your ticket.
- If you want to post a **feature request** or a **documentation request**, add `[Request]`
  to your issue's title (e.g. `[Request] Awesome new feature`). A question on how to run/change/setup
  something is **not** what qualifies as a request here, use the
  [community forum at community.octoprint.org](https://community.octoprint.org) for
  such support issues.
- If you are a **developer** that wants to brainstorm a pull request or possible
  changes to the plugin system, please get in touch on the
  [community forum at community.octoprint.org](https://community.octoprint.org/c/development).
- If you need **support**, have a **question** or some **other reason** that
  doesn't fit any of the above categories, the issue tracker is not the right place.
  Consult the [community forum at community.octoprint.org](https://community.octoprint.org/c/support) instead.

No matter what kind of ticket you create, never mix two or more "ticket reasons"
into one ticket: One ticket per bug, request, brainstorming thread please.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**
>
> A bot is in place that monitors new tickets, automatically
> categorizes them and checks new bug reports for usage of the provided template.
> That bot will only bother you if you open a ticket that appears to be a bug (no
> `[Request]` in the title) without the complete template, and it
> will do that only to ensure that all information needed to solve the issue is
> available for the maintainers to directly start tackling that problem.

## How to file a bug report

If you encounter an issue with OctoPrint, you are welcome to
[submit a bug report](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).

Before you do that for the first time though please take a moment to read the
following section *completely* and also follow the instructions in the
"new issue" form. Thank you! :)

### What should I do before submitting a bug report?

1. **Make sure you are at the right location**. This is the bug tracker
   of the official version of OctoPrint, which is the 3D print server and
   corresponding web interface itself.

   **OctoPrint doesn't manage your network connection or your webcam nor
   can it fix your printer not getting detected as a serial interface** -
   if you have any kinds of problems with that, get in touch on the
   [community forum](https://community.octoprint.org).

   **This is not the bug tracker of OctoPi**, which is the preconfigured
   Raspberry Pi image including OctoPrint among other things - that one can be found
   [here](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi). If you have any kind of specific
   issue with how the OctoPi system is setup, go there please.

   **This is also not the bug tracker of any OctoPrint Plugins you
   might have installed**. Report any issues with those in their corresponding
   bug tracker (probably linked to from the plugin's homepage).

   Finally, **this is also not the right bug tracker if you are running a
   forked version of OctoPrint**. Seek help for such unofficial versions from
   the people maintaining them instead.

2. Please make sure to **test out the current version** of OctoPrint to see
   whether the problem you are encountering still exists, and **test without
   any third-party plugins enabled** to make sure it's not a misbehaving
   plugin causing the issue at hand. For that please restart OctoPrint in
   **safe mode**, either by selecting "Restart OctoPrint in safe mode" from
   the "System" menu, or by starting OctoPrint from the command line with
   `octoprint serve --safe`. Then try to reproduce your issue. Find out
   more about safe mode in the [docs](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/safemode.html).

   You might also want to try the current development version of OctoPrint
   (if you aren't already). Refer to the [FAQ](https://faq.octoprint.org)
   for information on how to do this.

3. The problem still exists? Then please **look through the
   [existing tickets](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues?state=open)
   (use the [search](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/search?q=&ref=cmdform&type=Issues))**
   to check if there already exists a report of the issue you are encountering.
   Sorting through duplicates of the same issue sometimes causes more work than
   fixing it. Take the time to filter through possible duplicates and be really
   sure that your problem definitely is a new one. Try more than one search query
   (e.g. do not only search for "timelapse" if you happen to run into an issue
   with your webcam, also search for "recording" etc). Do not only read the subject lines
   of tickets that look like they might be related, but also read the ticket itself!

   **Very important:** Please make absolutely sure that if you find a bug that looks like
   it is the same as your's, it actually behaves the same as your's. E.g. if someone gives steps
   to reproduce his bug that looks like your's, reproduce the bug like that if possible,
   and only add a "me too" if you actually can reproduce the same
   issue. Also **provide all information like Systeminfo Bundle, additional logs & versions, different reproduction steps**
   and whatever was additionally requested over the course of the ticket
   even if you "only" add to an existing ticket. The more information available regarding a bug, the higher
   the chances of reproducing and solving it. But "me too" on an actually unrelated ticket
   makes it more difficult due to on top of having to figure out the original problem
   there's now also a [red herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring) interfering - so please be
   very diligent here!

If in doubt about any of the above - get in touch on the [community forums](https://community.octoprint.org)
instead of opening a ticket here. If you are actually running into a bug, we'll figure it out together
there.

### What should I include in a bug report?

First of all make sure your use **a descriptive title**. "It doesn't work"
and similar unspecific complaints are NOT descriptive titles.

**Always use the following template, even if only adding a "me too" to an
existing ticket**:

```
<!--
READ THE FOLLOWING FIRST:

If not already done, please read the the Contribution Guidelines that
are linked to the right under "Helpful resources" > "Contributing".

Also read the FAQ: https://faq.octoprint.org

This is a bug and feature tracker, please only use it to report bugs
or request features within OctoPrint (not OctoPi, not any OctoPrint
plugins and not unofficial OctoPrint versions).

Do not seek support here ("I need help with ...", "I have a
question ..."), that belongs on the community forum at
community.octoprint.org, NOT here.

Mark requests with a "[Request]" prefix in the title please. For bug
reports fully fill out the bug reporting template (if you don't know
where to find some information - it's all described in the Contribution
Guidelines linked up there in the big yellow box).

When reporting a bug do NOT delete ANY lines from the template.

Make sure any bug you want to report is still present with the CURRENT
OctoPrint version and that it does not vanish when you start OctoPrint
in safe mode - how to do that is also explained in the Contribution
Guidelines linked up there in the big yellow box.

Thank you!

#### What were you doing?

<!--
Please be as specific as possible here. The maintainers will need to
reproduce your issue in order to fix it and that is not possible if they
don't know what you did to get it to happen in the first place.

Ideally provide exact steps to follow in order to reproduce your problem:
-->

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

<!--
If you encountered a problem with specific files of any sorts, make sure
to also include a link to a file with which to reproduce the problem.
-->

#### What did you expect to happen?

#### What happened instead?

#### Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode?

<!--
Test if you can reproduce your problem in safe mode. You can find information
on how to enable safe mode in the Contribution Guidelines.

If you can't reproduce in safe mode, this is a bug with one of your
installed third party plugins. Don't open a ticket here!

If you can't test this in safe mode, state why.
-->

#### Version of OctoPrint

<!--
Can be found in the lower left corner of the web interface. ALWAYS INCLUDE.
-->

#### Printer model & used firmware incl. version

<!--
If applicable, always include if unsure.
-->

#### Browser and version of browser, operating system running browser

<!--
If applicable, always include if unsure.
-->

#### System Info Bundle

## Setting up a development environment

See [the corresponding chapter in the documentation](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/development/environment.html).
This also includes information on how to run the test suite and how to build
the documentation, the bundled virtual printer plugin and OctoPrint's versioning
and branching strategy.

## Pull requests

1. If you want to add a new feature to OctoPrint, **please always first
   consider if it wouldn't be better suited for a plugin.** As a general rule
   of thumb, any feature that is only of interest to a small sub group should
   be moved into a plugin. If the current plugin system doesn't allow you to
   implement your feature as a plugin, please get in touch on the
   [forums](https://community.octoprint.org/c/development) to get
   the discussion going on how best to solve *this* in OctoPrint's plugin
   system - maybe that's the actual PR you have been waiting for to contribute :)
2. If you plan to make **any large or otherwise disruptive changes to the
   code or appearance, please get in touch on the
   [forums](https://community.octoprint.org/c/development)** first so
   that we can determine if it's a good time for your specific pull
   request. It might be that we're currently in the process of making
   heavy changes to the code locations you'd target as well, or your
   approach doesn't fit the general "project vision", and that would
   just cause unnecessary work and frustration for everyone or
   possibly get the PR rejected.
3. Create your pull request **from a custom branch** on your end (e.g.
   `improve/myNewFeature`)[1].
4. Create your pull request **only against the `maintenance` or `devel` branch**:
     * if it's a bug fix for a bug in the current stable version, an improvement of existing functionality or a
       *small* backwards compatible new feature (e.g. a new hook, a new config flag, ...): `maintenance` branch
     * if it's a bigger backwards compatible new feature: please [get in touch](https://community.octoprint.org/c/development) first to avoid
       wasting work that doesn't match the current direction of the project or implement as a plugin.
     * if it's any breaking backwards incompatible change: `devel` branch. In case of big changes, [get in touch](https://community.octoprint.org/c/development) first.
5. Create **one pull request per feature/bug fix**.
6. Make sure there are **only relevant changes** included in your PR. No
   changes to unrelated files, no additional files that don't belong (e.g.
   commits of your full virtual environment). Make sure your PR consists
   **ideally of only one commit** (use git's rebase and squash functionality).
7. Make sure you **follow the current coding style**. This means:
     * Spaces for indenting and alignment, indentation width 4.
     * English language (code, variables, comments, ...)
     * Comments where necessary: Tell *why* the code does something like it does
       it, structure your code
     * Following the general architecture
     * If your PR needs to make changes to the Stylesheets, change the
       ``.less`` files from which the CSS is compiled.
     * Make sure you do not add dead code (e.g. commented out left-overs
       from experiments).
8. Ensure your changes **pass the existing unit tests**. PRs that break
   those cannot be accepted. You can run the unit tests locally (after
   [initial development environment setup with "develop" dependencies](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/development/environment.html))
   by running

   ```
   pytest
   ```

   in the OctoPrint checkout folder. An [automatic build workflow](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)
   is also setup so that if the tests should fail, your PR will be marked
   accordingly.
9. Run the **pre-commit check suite** against your changes. You can run that (after
   [initial development environment setup with "develop" dependencies](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/development/environment.html))
   by running

   ```
   pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files
   ```

   in the OctoPrint checkout folder. If you install the pre-commit hooks via
   `pre-commit install` (which you really should!) this will even be taken care of for you prior to committing.

   An [automatic build workflow](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)
   is in place that will run these checks - if they fail your PR will be marked accordingly.
10. **Test your changes thoroughly**. That also means testing with usage
    scenarios you don't normally use. If you only test with your printer, test with the
    virtual printer and vice versa. State in your pull request how you tested
    your changes. Ideally **add unit tests** - OctoPrint severely lacks in that
    department, but we are trying to change that, so any new code already covered
    with a test suite helps a lot!
11. In your pull request's description, **state what your pull request does**,
    as in, what feature does it implement, what bug does it fix. The more
    thoroughly you explain your intent behind the PR here, the higher the
    chances it will get merged fast. There is a template provided below
    that can help you here.
12. Don't forget to **add yourself to the [AUTHORS](./AUTHORS.md)
    file** :)

Template to use for Pull Request descriptions:

```
#### What does this PR do and why is it necessary?

#### How was it tested? How can it be tested by the reviewer?

#### Any background context you want to provide?

#### What are the relevant tickets if any?

#### Screenshots (if appropriate)

#### Further notes
```

## Footnotes
  * [1] - If you are wondering why, the problem is that anything that you add
    to your PR's branch will also become part of your PR, so if you create a
    PR from your version of `devel` chances are high you'll add changes to the
    PR that do not belong to the PR.
