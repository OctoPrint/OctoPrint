# OctoPrint Changelog

## 1.2.0 (Unreleased)

### New Features

* Added internationalization of UI. Translations of OctoPrint are being crowd sourced via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/octoprint/).
  The following translations are already available with more in the works:
  - Dutch (nl)
  - German (de)
  - French (fr)
  - Hebrew (he)
  - Norwegian (no)
  - Romanian (ro)
* New file list: Pagination is gone, no more (mobile incompatible) pop overs, instead scrollable and with instant
  search
* You can now define a folder (default: `~/.octoprint/watched`) to be watched for newly added GCODE (or -- if slicing
  support is enabled -- STL) files to automatically add.
* OctoPrint now has a [plugin system](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/devel/plugins/index.html) which allows extending its 
  core functionality.
* New type of API key: [App Session Keys](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/devel/api/apps.html) for trusted applications
* Printer Profiles: Printer properties like print volume, extruder offsets etc are now managed via Printer Profiles. A
  connection to a printer will always have a printer profile associated.
* OctoPrint now supports `action:...` commands received via debug messages (`// action:...`) from the printer. Currently supported are
  - `action:pause`: Pauses the current job in OctoPrint
  - `action:resume`: Resumes the current job in OctoPrint
  - `action:disconnect`: Disconnects OctoPrint from the printer
  Plugins can add supported commands by [hooking](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/devel/plugins/hooks.html) into the
  ``octoprint.comm.protocol.action`` hook
* Mousing over the webcam image in the control tab enables key control mode, allowing you to quickly move the axis of your
  printer with your computer's keyboard ([#610](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/610)):
  - arrow keys: X and Y axes
  - W, S / PageUp, PageDown: Y axes
  - Home: Home X and Y axes
  - End: Home Z axes
  - 1, 2, 3, 4: change step size used (0.1, 1, 10, 100mm)
* Controls for adjusting feed and flow rate factor added to Controls ([#362](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/362))
* Custom controls now also support slider controls
* Custom controls now support a row layout
* Users can now define custom GCODE scripts to run upon starting/pausing/resuming/success/failure of a print or for
  custom controls ([#457](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/457), [#347](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/347))

### Improvements

* Logging is now configurable via config file
* Added last print time to additional GCODE file information
* Better error handling for capture issues during timelapse creation & more robust handling of missing images during
  timelapse creation
* Start counting the layers at 1 instead of 0 in the GCODE viewer
* Upgraded [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to version 3.2.1
* Better error reporting for timelapse rendering and system commands
* Custom control can now be defined so that they show a Confirm dialog with configurable text before executing 
  ([#532](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/532) and [#590](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/590))
* Slicing has been greatly improved:
  * It now allows for a definition of slicing profiles to use for slicing plus overrides which can be defined per slicing 
    job (defining overrides is not yet part of the UI but it's on the roadmap).
  * A new slicing dialog has been added which allows (re-)slicing uploaded STL files (which are now displayed in the file list
    as well). This dialog also allows specifying which action to take after slicing has been completed (none, selecting the
    sliced GCODE for printing or starting to print it directly)
  * Slicers themselves are integrated into the system via ``SlicingPlugins``. 
  * The [Cura integration](https://github.com/daid/Cura) has changed in such a way that OctoPrint now calls the 
    [CuraEngine](https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine) directly instead of depending on the full Cura installation. See 
    [the wiki](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Cura) for instructions on how to change your setup to 
    accommodate the new integration.
  * The "Slicing done" notification is now colored green ([#558](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/558)).
  * The slicing API allows positioning the model to slice on the print bed (Note: this is not yet available in the UI).
* File management now supports STL files as first class citizens (including UI adjustments to allow management of
  uploaded STL files including removal and reslicing) and also allows folders (not yet supported by UI). STL files
  can be downloaded like GCODE files.
* Also interpret lines starting with "!!" as errors
* Added deletion of pyc files to the `python setup.py clean` command
* Settings now show a QRCode for the API Key ([#637](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/637))
* Username in UI is no longer enclosed in scare quotes ([#595](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/595))
* Username in login dialog is not automatically capitalized on mobile devices anymore ([#639](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/639))
* "Slicing Done" and "Streaming Done" notifications now have a green background ([#558](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/558))
* Files that are currently in use, be it for slicing, printing or whatever, are now tracked and can not be deleted as
  long as they are in use
* Settings in UI get refreshed when opening settings dialog
* New event "SettingsUpdated"
* "Print time left" is now not displayed until it becomes somewhat stable. Display in web interface now also happens
  in a fuzzy way instead of the format hh:mm:ss, to not suggest a high accuracy anymore where the can't be one. Additionally
  OctoPrint will use data from prior prints to enhance the initial print time estimation.
* Added handler for uncaught exceptions to make sure those get logged, should make the logs even more useful for analysing
  bug reports
* The server now tracks the modification date of the configuration file and reloads it prior to saving the config if
  it has been changed during runtime by external editing, hence no config settings added manually while the server
  was running should be overwritten anymore.
* Automatically hard-reload the UI if upon reconnecting to the server a new version is detected.
* Better handling of errors on the websocket - no more logging of the full stack trace to the log, only a warning
  message for now.
* Daemonized OctoPrint now cleans up its pidfile when receiving a TERM signal ([#711](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/711))
* Added serial types for OpenBSD ([#551](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/551))
* Improved behaviour of terminal:
  * Disabling autoscrolling now also stops cutting of the log while it's enabled, effectively preventing log lines from
    being modified at all ([#735](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/735))
  * Applying filters displays ``[...]`` where lines where removed and doesn't cause scrolling on filtered lines
    anymore ([#286](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/286))
  * Added a link to scroll to the end of the terminal log (useful for when autoscroll is disabled)
  * Added a link to select all current contents of the terminal log for easy copy-pasting
  * Added a display of how many lines are displayed, how many are filtered and how many are available in total
* Frame rate for timelapses can now be configured per timelapse ([#782](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/782))
* Added an option to specify the amount of encoding threads for FFMPEG ([#785](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/785))
* "Disconnected" screen now is not shown directly after a close of the socket, instead the client first tries to
  directly reconnect once, and only if that doesn't work displays the dialog. Should reduce short popups of the dialog
  due to shaky network connections and/or weird browser behaviour when downloading things from the UI.
* Development dependencies can now be installed with ``pip -e .[develop]``
* White and transparent colors ;) are supported for the navigation bar ([#789](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/789))
* Drag-n-drop overlay for file uploads now uses the full available screen space, improving usability on high resolution
  displays ([#187](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/187))
* OctoPrint server should no longer hang when big changes in the system time happen, e.g. after first contact to an
  NTP server on a Raspberry Pi image. Achieved through monkey patching Tornado with
  [this PR](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/pull/1290).
* Serial ports matching ``/dev/ttyAMA*`` are not anymore listed by default (this was the reason for a lot of people
  running into problems while attempting to connect to their printer on their Raspberry Pis, on which ``/dev/ttyAMA0`` 
  is the OS's serial console by default). Added configuration of additional ports to the Serial Connection section in 
  the Settings to make it easier for those people who do indeed have their printer connected to ``/dev/ttyAMA0``.
* Better behaviour of the settings dialog on low-width devices, navigation and content also now scroll independently 
  from each other (see also [#823](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/823))
* Renamed "Temperature Timeout" and "SD Status Timeout" in Settings to "Temperature Interval" and "SD Status Interval"
  to better reflect what those values are actually used for.
* Better behaviour of the settings dialog on mobile devices.
* Added support for rectangular printer beds with the origin in the center ([#682](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/682) 
  and [#852](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/852)). Printer profiles now contain a new settings ``volume.origin``
  which can either be ``lowerleft`` or ``center``. For circular beds only ``center`` is supported.
* Made baudrate detection a bit more solid, still can't perform wonders.
* Only show configuration options for additional extruders if more than one is available, and don't include offset
  configuration for first nozzle which acts as reference for the other offsets ([#677](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/677)).
* Cut off of the temperature graph is now not based on the number of data points any more but on the actual time of the
  data points. Anything older than ``n`` minutes will be cut off, with ``n`` defaulting to 30min. This value can be
  changed under "Temperatures" in the Settings ([#343](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/343)).
* High-DPI support for the GCode viewer ([#837](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/837)).
* Stop websocket connections from multiplying([#888](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/888)).

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.1.0...1.1.1))

## 1.1.0 (2014-09-03)

### New Features

* New REST API, including User API Keys additionally to the global API key. Please note that **this will break existing 
  API clients** as it replaces the old API (same endpoint). You can find the documentation of the new API at
  [docs.octoprint.org](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/1.1.0/api/index.html).
* New Event structure allows more flexibility regarding payload data, configuration files will be migrated automatically.
  You can find the documentation of the new event format and its usage at [docs.octoprint.org](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/1.1.0/events/index.html).
* Support for multi extruder setups. With this OctoPrint now in theory supports an unlimited amount of extruders, however
  for now it's artificially limited to 9.
* Log files can be accessed from within the browser via the Settings dialog ([#361](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/361))
* Timelapses can now have a post-roll duration configured which will be rendered into the video too to not let it
  end so abruptly ([#384](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/384))
* The terminal tab now has a command history ([#388](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/388))

### Improvements

* Stopping the application via Ctrl-C produces a less scary message ([#277](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/277))
* Webcam stream is disabled when control tab is not in focus, reduces bandwidth ([#316](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/316))
* M and G commands entered in Terminal tab are automatically converted to uppercase
* GCODE viewer now only loads automatically if GCODE file size is beneath certain threshold (different ones for desktop
  and mobile devices), only actually loads file if user acknowledges that this might be too much for his browser
* Added time needed for printing file to PrintDone event's payload ([#333](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/333))
* Also provide the filename (basename without the path) in print events
* Support for circular beds in the GCODE viewer ([#407](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/407))
* The dimensions of the print bed can now be configured via the Settings ([#396](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/396))
* Target temperature reporting format of Repetier Firmware is now supported as well ([360](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/360))
* Version tracking now based on git tagging and [versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer/). Version number,
  git commit and branch get reported in the format `<version tag>-<commits since then>-g<commit hash> (<branch> branch)`, 
  e.g. `1.2.0-dev-172-ga48b5de (devel branch)`.
* Made "Center viewport on model" and "Zoom in on model" in the GCODE viewer automatically deselect and de-apply if 
  viewport gets manipulated by the user ([#398](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/398))
* GCODE viewer now interprets inverted axes for printer control and mirrors print bed accordingly ([#431](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/431))
* Added `clean` command to `setup.py`, removes old build artifacts (mostly interesting for developers)
* Added version resource on API which reports application and API version
* Made the navbar static instead of fixed to improve usability on mobile devices ([#257](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/257))
* Switch to password field upon enter in username field, submit login form upon enter in password field
* Changed default path to OctoPrint executable in included init-script to `/usr/local/bin/octoprint` (the default when
  installing via `python setup.py install`)

### Bug Fixes

* Properly calculate time deltas (forgot to factor in days)
* [#35](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/35) - GCODE viewer has been modularized, options are now functional

* [#399](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/399) & [360](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/360) - Leave 
  bed temperature unset when not detected (instead of dying a horrible death)
* [#492](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/492) - Fixed a race condition which could lead to an attempt to read
  from an already closed serial port, causing an error to be displayed to the user
* [#257](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/257) - Logging in on mobile devices should now work
* [#476](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/476) - Also update the metadata correctly when an analysis finishes
