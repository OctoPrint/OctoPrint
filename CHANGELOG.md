# OctoPrint Changelog

## 1.2.0 (Unreleased)

### New Features

* Added internationalization of UI. Translations of OctoPrint are being crowd sourced via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/octoprint/).
  The following translations are already available with more in the works:
  - Dutch (nl)
  - German (de)
  - French (fr)
  - Hebrew (he)
  - Norwegian (no)
  - Romanian (ro)
* New file list: Pagination is gone, no more (mobile incompatible) pop overs, instead scrollable and with instant
  search
* You can now define a folder (default: `~/.octoprint/watched`) to be watched for newly added GCODE (or -- if slicing
  support is enabled -- STL) files to automatically add.
* OctoPrint now has a [plugin system](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/devel/plugins/index.html) which allows extending its 
  core functionality.

### Improvements

* Logging is now configurable via config file
* Added last print time to additional GCODE file information
* Better error handling for capture issues during timelapse creation & more robust handling of missing images during
  timelapse creation
* Start counting the layers at 1 instead of 0 in the GCODE viewer
* Upgraded [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to version 3.2.1
* Better error reporting for timelapse rendering and system commands
* Supports
* Custom control can now be defined so that they show a Confirm dialog with configurable text before executing 
  ([#532](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/532) and [#590](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/590))

### Bug Fixes

* [#435](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/435) - Always interpret negative duration (e.g. for print time left)
  as 0

## 1.1.1 (Unreleased)

### Bug Fixes

* [#580](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/580) - Properly unset job data when instructed so by callers

## 1.1.0 (2014-09-03)

### New Features

* New REST API, including User API Keys additionally to the global API key. Please note that **this will break existing 
  API clients** as it replaces the old API (same endpoint). You can find the documentation of the new API at
  [docs.octoprint.org](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/1.1.0/api/index.html).
* New Event structure allows more flexibility regarding payload data, configuration files will be migrated automatically.
  You can find the documentation of the new event format and its usage at [docs.octoprint.org](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/1.1.0/events/index.html).
* Support for multi extruder setups. With this OctoPrint now in theory supports an unlimited amount of extruders, however
  for now it's artificially limited to 9.
* Log files can be accessed from within the browser via the Settings dialog ([#361](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/361))
* Timelapses can now have a post-roll duration configured which will be rendered into the video too to not let it
  end so abruptly ([#384](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/384))
* The terminal tab now has a command history ([#388](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/388))

### Improvements

* Stopping the application via Ctrl-C produces a less scary message ([#277](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/277))
* Webcam stream is disabled when control tab is not in focus, reduces bandwidth ([#316](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/316))
* M and G commands entered in Terminal tab are automatically converted to uppercase
* GCODE viewer now only loads automatically if GCODE file size is beneath certain threshold (different ones for desktop
  and mobile devices), only actually loads file if user acknowledges that this might be too much for his browser
* Added time needed for printing file to PrintDone event's payload ([#333](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/333))
* Also provide the filename (basename without the path) in print events
* Support for circular beds in the GCODE viewer ([#407](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/407))
* The dimensions of the print bed can now be configured via the Settings ([#396](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/396))
* Target temperature reporting format of Repetier Firmware is now supported as well ([360](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/360))
* Version tracking now based on git tagging and [versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer/). Version number,
  git commit and branch get reported in the format `<version tag>-<commits since then>-g<commit hash> (<branch> branch)`, 
  e.g. `1.2.0-dev-172-ga48b5de (devel branch)`.
* Made "Center viewport on model" and "Zoom in on model" in the GCODE viewer automatically deselect and de-apply if 
  viewport gets manipulated by the user ([#398](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/398))
* GCODE viewer now interprets inverted axes for printer control and mirrors print bed accordingly ([#431](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/431))
* Added `clean` command to `setup.py`, removes old build artifacts (mostly interesting for developers)
* Added version resource on API which reports application and API version
* Made the navbar static instead of fixed to improve usability on mobile devices ([#257](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/257))
* Switch to password field upon enter in username field, submit login form upon enter in password field
* Changed default path to OctoPrint executable in included init-script to `/usr/local/bin/octoprint` (the default when
  installing via `python setup.py install`)

### Bug Fixes

* Properly calculate time deltas (forgot to factor in days)
* [#35](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/35) - GCODE viewer has been modularized, options are now functional
* [#337](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/337) - Also recognize `--iknowwhatimdoing` when running as daemon
* [#357](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/357) - Do not run GCODE analyzer when a print is ongoing
* [#381](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/381) - Only list those SD files that have an ASCII filename
* Fixed a race condition that could occur when pressing "Print" (File not opened yet, but attempt to read from it)
* [#398](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/398) - Fixed interfering options in GCODE viewer
* [#399](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/399) & [360](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/360) - Leave 
  bed temperature unset when not detected (instead of dying a horrible death)
* [#492](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/492) - Fixed a race condition which could lead to an attempt to read
  from an already closed serial port, causing an error to be displayed to the user
* [#257](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/257) - Logging in on mobile devices should now work
* [#476](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/476) - Also update the metadata correctly when an analysis finishes

  - [#314](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/314) - Use G28 for homing (G1 was copy and paste error)

  - [#326](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/326) - Fixed refresh of SD file list
  - [#338](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/338) - Refetch file list when deleting a file
  - [#339](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/339) - More error resilience when handling temperature offset data from the backend
  - [#345](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/345) - Also recognize such temperature reports that do not contain a `T:` but a `T0:`
