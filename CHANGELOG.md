# OctoPrint Changelog

## 1.1.2 (Unreleased)

### Improvements

* Added deletion of `*.pyc` files to `python setup.py clean` command, should help tremendously when switching branches (backported
  from [9e014eb](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/commit/9e014eba1feffde11ed0601d9c911b8cac9f3fb0))

### Bug Fixes

* [#634](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/634) - Fixed missing `branch` fields in version dicts generated
  by versioneer
* [IRC] - Don't hiccup on slic3r filament_diameter comments generated for multi extruder setups
* [ML] - Fixed relative URL to sockjs endpoint, wasn't yet using the proper base url
* [unreported] & [#698](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/698) - Generated URLs now take X-Forwarded-Host header
  sent by proxies into account for included host and port, also fixed [#698](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/698)
  introduced by this
* Small fixes for timelapse creation:
  - [#344](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/344) - Made timelapses capable of coping with missing captures in between by decrementing the image counter again if there
    was an error fetching the latest image from the snapshot URL (backport of [1a7a468](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/commit/1a7a468eb65fdf2a13b4c7a7723280e822c9c34b)
    and [bf9d5ef](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/commit/bf9d5efe43a1e57aacd8512125082ddca06b4efc))
  - [#693](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/693) -  Try not to capture an image if image counter is still unset
  - [unreported] Synchronize image counter decrementing as well as incrementing to prevent rare race conditions when generating the
    image file names

## 1.1.1 (2014-10-27)

### Improvements

* The API is now enabled by default and the API key -- if not yet set -- will be automatically generated on first
  server start and written back into ``config.yaml``
* Event subscriptions are now enabled by default (it was an accident that they weren't)
* Generate the key used for session hashing individually for each server instance
* Generate the salt used for hashing user passwords individually for each server instance

### Bug Fixes

* [#580](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/580) - Properly unset job data when instructed so by callers
* [#604](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/604) - Properly initialize settings basedir on server startup
* [IRC] Also allow downloading .g files via Tornado

## 1.1.0 (2014-09-03)

### New Features

* New REST API, including User API Keys additionally to the global API key. Please note that **this will break existing 
  API clients** as it replaces the old API (same endpoint). You can find the documentation of the new API at
  [docs.octoprint.org](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/1.1.0/api/index.html).
* New Event structure allows more flexibility regarding payload data, configuration files will be migrated automatically.
  You can find the documentation of the new event format and its usage at [docs.octoprint.org](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/1.1.0/events/index.html).
* Support for multi extruder setups. With this OctoPrint now in theory supports an unlimited amount of extruders, however
  for now it's artificially limited to 9.
* Log files can be accessed from within the browser via the Settings dialog ([#361](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/361))
* Timelapses can now have a post-roll duration configured which will be rendered into the video too to not let it
  end so abruptly ([#384](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/384))
* The terminal tab now has a command history ([#388](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/388))

### Improvements

* Stopping the application via Ctrl-C produces a less scary message ([#277](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/277))
* Webcam stream is disabled when control tab is not in focus, reduces bandwidth ([#316](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/316))
* M and G commands entered in Terminal tab are automatically converted to uppercase
* GCODE viewer now only loads automatically if GCODE file size is beneath certain threshold (different ones for desktop
  and mobile devices), only actually loads file if user acknowledges that this might be too much for his browser
* Added time needed for printing file to PrintDone event's payload ([#333](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/333))
* Also provide the filename (basename without the path) in print events
* Support for circular beds in the GCODE viewer ([#407](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/407))
* The dimensions of the print bed can now be configured via the Settings ([#396](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/396))
* Target temperature reporting format of Repetier Firmware is now supported as well ([360](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/360))
* Version tracking now based on git tagging and [versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer/). Version number,
  git commit and branch get reported in the format `<version tag>-<commits since then>-g<commit hash> (<branch> branch)`, 
  e.g. `1.2.0-dev-172-ga48b5de (devel branch)`.
* Made "Center viewport on model" and "Zoom in on model" in the GCODE viewer automatically deselect and de-apply if 
  viewport gets manipulated by the user ([#398](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/398))
* GCODE viewer now interprets inverted axes for printer control and mirrors print bed accordingly ([#431](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/431))
* Added `clean` command to `setup.py`, removes old build artifacts (mostly interesting for developers)
* Added version resource on API which reports application and API version
* Made the navbar static instead of fixed to improve usability on mobile devices ([#257](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/257))
* Switch to password field upon enter in username field, submit login form upon enter in password field
* Changed default path to OctoPrint executable in included init-script to `/usr/local/bin/octoprint` (the default when
  installing via `python setup.py install`)

### Bug Fixes

* Properly calculate time deltas (forgot to factor in days)
* [#35](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/35) - GCODE viewer has been modularized, options are now functional
* [#337](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/337) - Also recognize `--iknowwhatimdoing` when running as daemon
* [#357](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/357) - Do not run GCODE analyzer when a print is ongoing
* [#381](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/381) - Only list those SD files that have an ASCII filename
* Fixed a race condition that could occur when pressing "Print" (File not opened yet, but attempt to read from it)
* [#398](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/398) - Fixed interfering options in GCODE viewer
* [#399](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/399) & [360](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/360) - Leave 
  bed temperature unset when not detected (instead of dying a horrible death)
* [#492](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/492) - Fixed a race condition which could lead to an attempt to read
  from an already closed serial port, causing an error to be displayed to the user
* [#257](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/257) - Logging in on mobile devices should now work
* [#476](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/476) - Also update the metadata correctly when an analysis finishes
* Various fixes of bugs in newly introduced features and improvements:
  - [#314](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/314) - Use G28 for homing (G1 was copy and paste error)
  - [#317](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/317) - Fixed "load and print" function
  - [#326](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/326) - Fixed refresh of SD file list
  - [#338](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/338) - Refetch file list when deleting a file
  - [#339](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/339) - More error resilience when handling temperature offset data from the backend
  - [#345](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/345) - Also recognize such temperature reports that do not contain a `T:` but a `T0:`
  - [#377](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/377) - URLs in API examples fixed
  - [#378](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/378) - Fixed crash of API call when `getStartTime()` returns None
