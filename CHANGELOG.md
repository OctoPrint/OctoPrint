# OctoPrint Changelog

## 1.3.5 (2017-10-16)

### Improvements

  * [#1162](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1162) - Allow `octoprint.comm.protocol.gcode.queuing` hook to return a list of commands.
  * [#1572](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1572) & [#1881](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1881) - Refactored web interface startup process to minimise risk of race conditions and speed improvements. Also added sequence diagram to the documentation showing the new processing order.
  * [#1640](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1640) - Mouse over temperature graph to get exact data for that time.
  * [#1679](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1679) - Support temperature autoreporting by the firmware instead of polling if the firmware reports to support it. For this to work with Marlin 1.1.0 to 1.1.3 you'll need to explicitly enable `EXTENDED_CAPABILITIES_REPORT` *and* `AUTO_REPORT_TEMPERATURES` in your firmware configuration, otherwise your firmware won't report that it actually supports this feature.
  * [#1737](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1737) - Auto-detect Anet A8 firmware and treat as Repetier Firmware (which it actually appears to be, just renamed - thanks Anet for making this even harder). 
  * [#1842](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1842) - Update bundled FontAwesome to 4.7 (see also [#1915](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1915)).
  * [#1910](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1910) - Make last/pause/cancel temperature available for GCODE scripts.
  * [#1925](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1925) - Include configured webcam stream URL in "Webcam stream not loaded" message for logged in users/admins. Slightly different wording for guests vs users vs admins.
  * [#1941](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1941) - Enable "block while dwelling" flag when Malyan firmware is detected since that firmware seems to handle `G4` identically to Repetier Firmware instead of Marlin (like it claims to). See also [#1762](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1762).
  * [#1946](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1946) - Add option to disable position logging on cancel/pause. See "Log position on cancel" and "Log position on pause" under Settings > Serial > Advanced options.
  * [#1971](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1971) - Refactored temperature inputs. They now sport some fancy +/- buttons to increment/decrement the current temperature (which also auto submit after a couple of seconds) and easier editing by keyboard. The temperature offset was also slightly redesigned to make room for that.
  * [#1975](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1975) - Better error reporting when deleting timelapses.
  * [#2010](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2010) - Slight refactoring in the terminal tab: Full width input field, auto focus of input field when just clicking on terminal output.
  * [#2011](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2011) - Centralized online connectivity check (with opt-in of course). None of the bundled plugins will attempt to fetch data from the net when the connectivity check indicates that would fail anyhow. This should improve server startup times and various requests when running isolated.
  * [#2025](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2025) - More verbose logging of asynchronous system commands (e.g. restart/shutdown).
  * Allow timelapse configuration through UI even when not connected to the printer (suggested in [#1918](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1918))
  * Disable "Upload to SD" UI elements while printing (suggested in [#1914](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1914))
  * Update bundled SockJS to 1.1.2 incl. source maps
  * Set `X-Robots` HTTP header and remove `Server` header from all responses, also set `robots` meta tag in page.
  * Don't require to enter programmer mode for printer port autodetection when there's only one possible port candidate anyhow.
  * More sensible sorting of baudrates (additionally configured, then 115200, then 250000, then everything else).
  * Don't show "Unhandled communication error" on autodetection failure.
  * Make timeout after which to unload the webcam stream after navigating away from it configurable (as suggested in [#1937](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1937))
  * Add `ToolChange` event and tool change GCODE scripts
  * Support parsing GCODE subcodes.
  * Add `octoprint.users.factory` hook, allowing plugins to extend/swap out the user manager OctoPrint uses.
  * Corewizard: Disable view model and client code if it's not actually required.
  * Corewizard: Disable injection of JS files into UI when it's not actually required.
  * GCODE analysis: Moved into its own subprocess. That should improve performance on multi core systems.
  * GCODE viewer: Ignore coordinates outside bed when zooming/centering on model. Those usually are nozzle priming routines.
  * JS Client Lib: Add centralized browser detection as `OctoPrint.coreui.browser`. Available properties: `chrome`, `firefox`, `safari`, `ie`, `edge`, `opera` as well as `mobile` and `desktop`, all of which are boolean values.
  * Plugin Manager plugin: Detect if a plugin requires a reconnect to the printer to become fully active/inactive.
  * Software Update plugin: Force exact version when updating OctoPrint and tracking releases.
  * Software Update plugin: "Devel RCs" release channel now also tracks maintenance RCs. That way people don't have to toggle between the two any more to get *all* RCs.
  * Software Update plugin: `bitbucket_commit` check type now supports API credentials (see also [#1993](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1993)).
  * Wizard: Allow suppressing the "the settings got updated" dialog through subwizards, in case they need to update settings asynchronously as part of their workflow.
  * More resilience against expected folders being files.
  * More resilience against a wrong user manager class being configured.
  * Some code refactoring & cleanup.
  * Some HTML & CSS improvements.

### Bug fixes

  * [#1916](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1916) - Fix webcam not loading if first/initial tab is "Control"
  * [#1924](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1924) - Filter out source map links from bundled JS webassets.
  * [#1943](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1943) - Fix issue causing unnecessary creation of default printer profile on startup
  * [#1946](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1946) - Decouple writing of print log from everything else. Fixes delay in cancel processing.
  * [#1963](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1963) & [#1974](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1974) - Allow empty & custom size in print job events. Also fixes an issue with timelapses when printing from SD on printers that require the GPX plugin to work.
  * [#1996](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1996) - Support all line ending variantes in the GCODE viewer. Solves an issue with GCODE generated for Prusa's multi material extruder since that uses only `\r` for some reason.
  * [#2007](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2007) - Fix issue parsing temperature lines from the printer that contain negative values.
  * [#2012](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2012) - Fix command line interface of Software Update plugin.
  * [#2017](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2017) - Fix issue in GCODE viewer with files that contain a visit to the first layer twice (e.g. brim, then nose dive from higher z for actual model), causing all but the last layer segment to not be rendered.
  * [#2033](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2033) (regression) - Temperature tab: Fix for legend in graph not updating with current values on mouse over.
  * [#2033](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2033) (regression) - Temperature tab: Fix for new temperature inputs not fitting on one line in Firefox.
  * [#2033](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2033) (regression) - Temperature tab & GCODE viewer: Fix for available tools (and offsets) not properly updating on change of printer profile.
  * [#2033](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2033) (regression) - Wizard: Fix sorting of required wizards not properly handling non-ASCII unicode.
  * [#2035](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2035) (regression) - Fix an issue of the server not starting up if there's a file in the analysis backlog. The reason for this is that spawning a new process while the intermediary server is active causes the server port to be blocked (this is due to how subprocessing works by default), in turn leading to an error on startup since the port cannot be bound by the actual server. Since the GCODE analysis takes now place in its own subprocess and hence triggers this problem, it had to be moved until after the actual server has already started up to avoid this problem.
  * [#2059](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2059) (regression) - Fix an issue causing the new temperature controls to wrap on touch enabled devices when the temperature dropdown is opened.
  * [#2090](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2090) (regression) - Fix an issue causing an aborted server startup under Windows if the timing is just right.
  * [#2135](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2135) (regression) - Fix an issue causing import errors inside the GCODE analysis tool in certain environments due to `sys.path` entries causing relative imports.
  * [#2136](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2136) (regression) - Fix wrong minimum version for `sockjs-tornado` dependency.
  * [#2137](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2137) (regression) - Fix issue with session cookies getting lost when running an OctoPrint instance on a subpath of another (e.g. `octopi.local/` and `octopi.local/octoprint2`).
  * [#2140](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2140) (regression) - Fix issue with locale dependent sorting of sub wizards during first time setup causing issues leading to the wizard not being able to complete.
  * Fix various popup buttons allowing multiple clicks (suggested in [#1914](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1914))
  * Software Update Plugin: Perform server restart asynchronously. Should reduce restart times on updates significantly.
  * Don't hex-escape `\t`, `\r` or `\n` in terminal output
  * Use client side default printer profile if the default profile could not be found on the server
  * Use both "to" and "from" coordinates of a given move for min/max model coordinate calculation in GCODE analysis. Otherwise wrong values could be calculated under certain circumstances.  
  * Fix potential race condition in resend request handling.
  * Fix potential race condition in web socket handling.
  * Fix handling of tool offsets in GCODE analysis - diverted too far from firmware implementations, causing wrong calculations.
  * Fix `FileAdded`, `FileRemoved`, `FolderAdded`, `FolderRemoved` events not being fired with the correct event name.
  * Fix potential division by zero in progress reporting if the timing was just right.
  * Fix sorting order for multiple tools in the "State" panel.
  * Fix file position vs. line ending handling in GCODE viewer. Could lead to slightly off file position calculation and hence possibly to the wrong move being plotted when synchronizing with print progress.
  * Wizard: Fix `onWizardPreventSettingsRefreshDialog` callback invocation. (regression)
  * Corewizard plugin: Fix `firstrunonly` wizards (e.g. for printer profile configuration) being displayed again if _any_ of the sub wizards (e.g. for the online check opt-in and configuration) is active. (regression)
  * Fix an issue causing rollover of `serial.log` to fail under Windows. (regression)

## 1.3.4 (2017-06-01)

### Note for owners of Malyan M200/Monoprice Select Mini

OctoPrint's firmware autodetection is now able to detect this printer. Currently when this printer is detected, the following firmware specific features will be enabled automatically:

  * Always assume SD card is present (`feature.sdAlwaysAvailable`)
  * Send a checksum with the command: Always (`feature.alwaysSendChecksum`)

Since the firmware is a very special kind of beast and its sources are so far unavailable, only tests with a real printer will show if those are sufficient settings for communication with this printer to fully function correctly. Thus, if you run into any issues with enabled firmware autodetection on this printer model, please add a comment in [#1762](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1762) and explain what kind of communication problem you are seeing. Also make sure to include a [`serial.log`](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#where-can-i-find-those-log-files-you-keep-talking-about)!

### Bug fixes

  * [#1942](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1942) - Fixed crash on startup in case of an invalid default printer profile combined with "auto-connect on startup" being selected and the printer available to connect to.

### More information

  * [Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.3.1...1.3.2)
  * Release Candidates:
    * None since this constitutes a hotfix release to fix an apparently very rare bug introduced with 1.3.3 that seems to be affecting a small number of users.

## 1.3.3 (2017-05-31)

### Improvements

  * [#478](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/478) - Made webcam stream container fixed height (with selectable aspect ratio) to prevent jumps of the controls beneath it on load.
  * [#748](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/748) - Added delete confirmation and bulk delete for timelapses. See also the discussion in brainstorming ticket [#1807](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1807).
  * [#1092](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1092) - Added new events to the file manager: `FileAdded`, `FileRemoved`, `FolderAdded`, `FolderRemoved`. Contrary to the `Upload` event, `FileAdded` will always fire when a file was added to storage through the file manager, not only when added through the web interface. Extended documentation accordingly.
  * [#1521](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1521) - Software update plugin: Display timestamp of last version cache refresh in "Advanced options" area.
  * [#1734](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1734) - Treat default/initial printer profile like all other printer profiles, persisting it to disk instead of `config.yaml` and allowing deletion. OctoPrint will migrate the existing default profile to the new location on first start.
  * [#1734](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1734) - Better communication of what actions are available for printer profiles.
  * [#1739](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1739) - Software update plugin: Added option to hide update notification from users without admin rights, added "ignore" button and note to get in touch with an admit to update notifications for non admin users.
  * [#1762](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1762) - Added Malyan M200/Monoprice Select Mini to firmware autodetection.
  * [#1811](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1811) - Slight rewording and rearrangement in timelapse configuration, better feedback if settings have been saved.
  * [#1818](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1818) - Support both Marlin/Repetier and Smoothieware interpretations of `G90` after an `M83` in GCODE viewer and analysis. Select "G90/G91 overrides relative extruder mode" in Settings > Features for the Smoothieware interpretation.
  * [#1858](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1858) - Announcement plugin: Images from registered feeds now are lazy loading.
  * [#1862](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1862) - Automatically re-enable fancy terminal functionality when performance recovers.
  * [#1875](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1875) - Marked the command input field in the Terminal tab as not supporting autocomplete to work around an issue in Safari. Note that this is probably only a temporary workaround due to browser vendors [working on deprecating `autocomplete="off"` support](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=468153#c164) and a different solution will need to be found in the future.
  * Added link to [`SerialException` FAQ entry](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ#octoprint-randomly-loses-connection-to-the-printer-with-a-serialexception) to terminal output when such an error is encountered, as suggested in [#1876](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1876).
  * Force refresh of settings on login/logout.
  * Made system wide API key management mirror user API key management.
  * Make sure to always migrate and merge saved printer profiles with default profile to ensure all parameters are set. Should avoid issues with plugins trying to save outdated/incomplete profiles.
  * Added note on lack of language pack repository & to use the wiki for now.
  * Earlier validation of file to select for printing.
  * Limit verbosity of failed system event handlers.
  * Made bundled python client `octoprint_client` support multiple client instances.
  * Disable "Reload" button in the "Please reload" overlay once clicked, added spinner.
  * Updated pnotify to 2.1.0.
  * Get rid of ridiculous float precision in temperature commands.
  * Detect invalid settings data to persist (not a dict), send 400 status in such a case.
  * More logging for preemptive caching, to help narrow down any performance issues that might be related to this.
  * Further decoupling of some startup tasks from initial server startup thread for better parallelization and improved startup times.
  * Announcement plugin: Added combined OctoBlog feed, replacing news and spotlight feed, added corresponding config migration.
  * Announcement plugin: Subscribe to all registered feeds by default to ensure better communication flow (all subscriptions but the "Important" channel can however be unsubscribed easily, added corresponding note to the notifications and also a configuration button to the announcement reader).
  * Announcement plugin: Auto-hide announcements on logout.
  * Announcement plugin: Order channels server-side based on new order config setting.
  * Plugin manager: Show warning when disabling a bundled plugin that is not recommended to be disabled, including a reason why disabling it is not recommended. Applies to the bundled announcement, core wizard, discovery and software update plugins.
  * Plugin manager: Support for plugin notices for specific plugins from the plugin repository, e.g. to inform users of specific plugins about known issues with the plugin or instruct to update when the software update mechanism of the current plugin version turns out to be misconfigured. Supports matching installed plugin versions and OctoPrint versions to target only affected users.
  * Plugin manager: Better visualization of plugins disabled on the repository, no longer shown as "incompatible" but "disabled", with link to the plugin repository page that contains more information.
  * Plugin manager: Detect necessity to reinstall a plugin provided through archive URL or upload and immediately do that instead of reporting an "unknown error" without further information.
  * Plugin manager: Added `freebsd` for compatibility check.
  * Plugin manager: More general flexibility for OS compatibility check:
    * Support for arbitrary values to match against
    * Allow 1:1 check again `sys.platform` values (with `startswith`).
    * Support black listing (`!windows`) additionally to white listing. A detected OS must match all provided white list elements (if the white list is empty that is considered to be always the case) and none of the black list elements (if the black list is empty that is also considered to be always the case).
  * Software update plugin: New check type `bitbucket_commit` (see also [#1898](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1898))
  * Docs: Now referring to dedicated Jinja 2.8 documentation as hosted at [jinja.octoprint.org](http://jinja.octoprint.org) for all template needs, to avoid confusion when consulting current Jinja documentation as available on its project page (2.9+, which OctoPrint can't upgrade to due to backwards incompatible changes).
  * Docs: Better documentation of what kind of input the `FileManager` accepts for `select_file`.
  * Docs: Specified OctoPrint version required for plugin tutorial.

### Bug fixes

  * [#1837](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1837) - Fixed a race condition causing OctoPrint trying to read data from the current job on job cancel that was no longer there.
  * [#1838](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1838) - Fixed a rare race condition causing an error right at the very start of a print.
  * [#1863](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1863) - Fixed an issue in the analysis of GCODE files containing coordinate offsets for X, Y or Z via `G92`, leading to a wrong calculation of the model size thanks to accumulating offsets.
  * [#1882](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1882) - Fixed a rare race condition occurring at the start of streaming a file to the printer's SD card, leading to endless line number mismatches.
  * [#1884](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1884) - CuraEngine plugin: Fixed a potential encoding issue when logging non-ASCII parameters supplied to CuraEngine
  * [#1891](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1891) - Fixed error when handling unicode passwords.

  * [#1918](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1918) (regression) - Fix "save as default" checkbox not being disabled when other controls are disabled.
  * [#1919](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1919) (regression) - Fix call to no longer existing function in Plugin Manager UI.
  * [#1934](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1934) (regression) - Fix consecutive timed timelapse captures without configured post roll.
  * Fixed API key QR Code being shown (for "n/a" value) when no API key was set.
  * Fixed timelapse configuration API not returning 400 status code on some bad parameters.
  * Fixed a typo (see also [#1826](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1826)).
  * Fixed `filter` and `force` parameters on `/api/files/<origin>`.
  * Fixed message catchall `*` not working in the socket client library.
  * Fixed analysis backlog calculation for sub folders.
  * Fixed `PrinterInterface.is_ready` to behave as documented.
  * Use black listing instead of white listing again to detect if the `daemon` sub command is supported or not. Should resolve issues users of FreeBSD and the like where having with `octoprint daemon`.
  * Use `pip` instead of `python setup.py develop` in `octoprint dev plugin:install` command to avoid issues on Windows.
  * Docs: Fixed a wrong command in the plugin tutorial (see also [#1860](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1860)).

## 1.3.2 (2017-03-16)

### Note for plugin authors

**If you maintain a plugin that extends OctoPrint's [JavaScript Client Library](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/jsclientlib/index.html)** like demonstrated in e.g. the bundled Software Update Plugin you'll need to update the way you register your plugin to depend on `OctoPrintClient` and registering your extension as shown [here](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/blob/6e793c2/src/octoprint/plugins/softwareupdate/static/js/softwareupdate.js#L1-L84) instead of directly writing to `OctoPrint.plugins` (like it was still done [here](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/blob/23744cd/src/octoprint/plugins/softwareupdate/static/js/softwareupdate.js#L1-L81)). That way your extensions will be available on all instances of `OctoPrintClient`, not just the global instance `OctoPrint` that gets created on startup of the core web interface.

If all you plugin does with regards to JavaScript is registering a custom view model and you have no idea what I'm talking about regarding extending the client library, no action is necessary. This heads-up is really only relevant if you extended the JavaScript Client Library.

### Improvements

- [#732](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/732) - Have OctoPrint's `python setup.py clean` build on stock
`python setup.py clean` for better compatibility with packaging systems
- [#1506](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1506) - Better handle really long "dwell"/`G4` commands on Repetier firmware (as for example apparently recommended to use with Wanhao D6 and similar printers for nozzle cooling) by actively stalling communication from OctoPrint's side as well. That way we no longer run into a communication timeout produced by a 5min dwell immediately happily acknowledged by the printer with an `ok`.
- [#1542](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1542) - Support for multi-extruder setups with a shared single nozzle and heater (e.g. E3D Cyclops, Diamond hotend, etc).
- [#1676](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1676) - Trigger line number reset when connected to printer and seeing `start` message. This should fix issues with printer communication when printer resets but reset goes otherwise undetected.
- [#1681](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1681) - Support for connecting to multiple OctoPrint instances via the [JavaScript Client Library](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/jsclientlib/index.html).
- [#1712](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1712) - Display current folder name in file list if in sub folder.
- [#1723](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1723) - Ignore leading `v` or `V` on plugin version numbers for version checks in plugin manager and software updater (see also [#1724](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1724))
- [#1770](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1770) - Better resilience against null bytes received from the printer for whatever reason.
- [#1770](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1770) - Detect printer as connected even when only receiving a `wait` instead of `ok`. Should solve issues with initial connect where printer sends garbage over the line that eats/covers the `ok` if printer also sends regular `wait` messages when idle.
- [#1780](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1780) - Work around for Safari re-opening one copy of the webcam stream after the other and eating up bandwidth unnecessarily (see also [#1786](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1786))
- [#1790](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1790) - Removed unused "color" property from printer profile editor.
- [#1805](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1805) - Better error resilience against invalid print history data from plugins that replace the printer communication.
- Better error resilience in Plugin Manager against wonky version data in repository file.
- Added a "Restart in safe mode" system menu entry that will always be available if the restart command is configured
- CLI: Only offer `daemon` sub command on Linux (since that it's the only OS it works on)
- Less throttling of analysis of GCODE files from the analysis backlog. Should still leave Pi and friends air to breathe but allow a slightly faster processing of the backlog.
- Added an explanation of safe mode to the docs.
- Log OctoPrint version & plugin list when detecting log rollover.
- Allow `UiPlugin`s to define additional fields for ETag generation.
- Allow `UiPlugin`s utilizing OctoPrint's stock templates to filter out what they don't need.
- Locales contained in `translations` of plugins will now be registered with the system. That way it's possible to provide translations for the full application through plugins.
- Abort file analysis if file is about to be overwritten
- Software Update Plugin: Refresh cache on startup, prevent concurrent refresh
- More solid parsing of request line number for resend requests. Should improve compatibility with Teacup firmwares. Based on issue reported via PR [#300](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/300)

### Bug fixes

- [#733](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/733) - Fixed multiple event handler commands running concurrently. Now they run one after the other, as expected.
- [#1317](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1317) - Fixed a color distortion issue when rendering timelapses from higher resolution source snapshots that also need to be rotated by adjusting `ffmpeg` parameters to avoid an unexpected behaviour when a pixel format and a filter chain are required for processing.
- [#1560](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1560) - Make sure we don't try to use an empty `logging.yaml`
- [#1631](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1631) - Disable "Slice" button in slice dialog if a print is ongoing and a slicer is selected that runs on the same device as OctoPrint. The server would already deny such requests (simply due to performance reasons), but the UI didn't properly reflect that yet.
- [#1671](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1671) - Removed "Hide empty folders" option from file list. Didn't really add value and caused usability issues.
- [#1771](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1771) - Fixed `_config_version` in plugin settings not being properly updated.
- [#1732](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1732) - Fixed a bug in the documentation for the printer profile API
- [#1760](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1760) - Fixed missing reselect of selected file when updating via the watched folder, causing wrong progress percentages to be reported.
- [#1765](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1765) - Fixed watched folder not waiting with file move until file stopped growing, causing wrong progress percentages to be reported.
- [#1777](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1777) - Fixed z-change based timelapses with Slic3r generated z-hops not properly triggering snapshots.
- [#1792](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1792) - Don't tell Safari we are "web-app-capable" because that means it will throw away all cookies and the user will have to constantly log in again when using a desktop shortcut for the OctoPrint instance.
- [#1812](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1812) - Don't scroll up navigation in settings when switching between settings screens, very annoying on smaller resolutions (see also [#1814](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1814))
- Fix settings helper not allowing to delete values for keys that are present in the local config but not in the defaults.
- Fix wrong replacement value for `__progress` in registered command line or GCODE [event handlers](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/events/index.html).
- Various fixes in the Software Update Plugin:
  - Don't remove manual software update configurations on settings migration.
  - Properly delete old restart/reboot commands that are now defined globally since config version 4. An issue with the settings helper prevented us from properly deleting them during migration to version 4.
  - Fixed `python_checker` version check method and `python_updater` update method.
  - Fixed update configs without a restart of any kind causing an issue due to an undefined variable.
  - Fixed broken doctests.
- Upgrade LESS.min.js from 2.7.1 to 2.7.2 to fix the broken contrast function
- Always create a new user session for requests with an API key
- Fixed an error when reading all user settings via the API
- Fixed a bunch of caching issues for the page, was not properly updated on change of snapshot URL presence, system menu entry presence, gcode viewer enabled/disabled, changes in access control availability.
- Fixed wrong bundling of core and plugin assets
- Software Update Plugin: Fixed wrong ETag calculation
- Disable external heatup detection until firmware is detected
- Fixed login dropdown not closing on click outside of it
- Fixed new user settings getting lost until restart
- Don't call `onUserLoggedIn`/`onUserLoggedOut` on user reload

- Release Candidates:
  - [1.3.2rc1](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.2rc1)

## 1.3.1 (2017-01-25)

### Note for upgraders

#### If you installed OctoPrint manually and used the included init script, you need to update that

The init script so far shipped with OctoPrint contained a [bug](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1657) that causes issues with OctoPrint 1.3.0 and higher. Please update your init script to the fixed version OctoPrint now ships under `scripts`:

```
sudo cp /path/to/OctoPrint/scripts/octoprint.init /etc/init.d/octoprint
```

If you are running OctoPi, this does **not** apply to you and you do not need to do anything here!

#### Change in stock terminal filter configuration

1.3.1 fixes an issue with the two terminal filters for suppressing temperature and SD status messages and adds a new filter for filtering out firmware `wait` messages. These changes will only be active automatically though for stock terminal filter configurations. If you have customized your terminal filters, you'll need to apply these changes manually under "Settings > Terminal filters":
- Changed "Suppress temperature messages" filter, new regex is `(Send: (N\d+\s+)?M105)|(Recv: ok (B|T\d*):)`
- Changed "Suppress SD status messages" filter, new regex is `(Send: (N\d+\s+)?M27)|(Recv: SD printing byte)`
- New "Suppress wait responses" filter, regex is `Recv: wait`

### Improvements
- [#1607](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1607) - Way better support for password managers (e.g. browser built-in, 1Password, Lastpass, Dashlane)
- [#1638](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1638) - Make confirmation dialog when cancelling a print optional.
- [#1656](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1656) - Make wording of buttons on print cancel dialog less confusing.
- [#1705](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1705) - Simplified install process on Mac by removing dependency on pyobjc.
- [#1706](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1706) - Added a mask icon for Safari pinned tab and touchbar.
- Support extraction of filament diameter for volume calculation from GCODE files sliced through Simplify3D.
- Abort low priority jobs in the file analysis queue when a high priority job comes in - should make file analysis and hence time estimates show up faster for newly uploaded files.
- Added a terminal filter for firmware `wait` messages to the stock terminal filters. If you did modify your terminal filter configuration, you might want to add this manually:
  - New "Suppress wait responses" filter: `Recv: wait`

- [#1660](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1660) - Do not show hint regarding keyboard controls beneath webcam stream if keyboard control feature is disabled.
- [#1667](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1667) - Fix for matching folders not getting listed in the results when performing a search in the file list.
- [#1675](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1675) - Fix model size calculation in GCODE analysis, produced wrong values in some cases. Also adjusted calculation to match implementation in GCODE viewer, now both produce identical results.

- [#1697](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1697) - Pin Jinja to versions <2.9 for now due to a backwards compatibility issue with templates for versions newer than that. Also pushed as a hotfix to 1.3.0 (as 1.3.0post1).
- [#1708](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1708) - Cura Plugin: Fixed selection of `start.gcode` for sliced file
- Allow a retraction z-hop of 0 in timelapse configuration.
- Fix files in sub folders to not be processed by the initial analysis backlog check during startup of the server.
- Various fixes in the file analysis queue:
  - High priority items are now really high priority
  - Abort analysis for items that are to be deleted/moved to get around an issue with file access under Windows systems.
- Fix stock terminal filters for suppressing temperature messages and SD status messages to also be able to deal with line number prefixes. If you have added additional terminal filters, you will have to apply this fix manually:
  - Changed "Suppress temperature messages" filter: `(Send: (N\d+\s+)?M105)|(Recv: ok (B|T\d*):)`
  - Changed "Suppress SD status messages" filter: `(Send: (N\d+\s+)?M27)|(Recv: SD printing byte)`
- Fix issue in german translation.

  - [1.3.1rc1](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.1rc1)
  - [1.3.1rc2](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.1rc2)

## 1.3.0 (2016-12-08)

### Features

  * You can now create folders in the file list, upload files into said folders and thus better manage your projects' files.
  * New wizard dialog for system setups that can also be extended by plugins. Replaces the first run dialog for setting up access control and can also be triggered in other cases than only the first run, e.g. if plugins necessitate user input to function properly. Added wizards to help configuring the following components in OctoPrint on first run: access control, webcam URLs & ffmpeg path, server commands (restart, shutdown, reboot), printer profile. Also extended the bundled Cura plugin to add a wizard for its first setup to adjust path and import a slicing profile, and the bundled Software Update plugin to ask the user for details regarding the OctoPrint update configuration. Also see below.
  * New command line interface (CLI). Offers the same functionality as the old one plus:
    * a built-in API client (``octoprint client --help``)
    * built-in development tools (``octoprint dev --help``)
    * extendable through plugins implementing the ``octoprint.cli.commands`` hook (``octoprint plugins --help``)
  * New features within the plugin system:
    * Plugins may now give hints in which order various hooks or mixin methods should be called by optionally providing an integer value that will be used for sorting the callbacks prior to execution.
    * Plugins may now define configuration overlays to be applied on top of the default configuration but before ``config.yaml``.
    * New mixin `UiPlugin` for plugins that want to provide an alternative web interface delivered by the     server.
    * New mixin ``WizardPlugin`` for plugins that want to provide wizard components to OctoPrint's new wizard dialog.
    * New hook ``octoprint.cli.commands`` for registering a command with the new OctoPrint CLI
    * New hook ``octoprint.comm.protocol.gcode.received`` for receiving messages from the printer
    * New hook ``octoprint.printer.factory`` for providing a custom factory to contruct the global ``PrinterInterface`` implementation.
    * New ``TemplatePlugin`` template type: ``wizard``
  * New Javascript client library for utilizing the server's API, can be reused by `UiPlugin`s.
  * OctoPrint will now track the current print head position on pause and cancel and provide it as new template variables ``pause_position``/``cancel_position`` for the relevant GCODE scripts. This will allow more intelligent pause codes that park the print head at a rest position during pause and move it back to the exact position it was before the pause on resume ([Example](https://gist.github.com/foosel/1c09e269b1c0bb7a471c20eef50c8d3e)). Note that this is NOT enabled by default and for now will necessitate adjusting the pause and resume GCODE scripts yourself since position tracking with multiple extruders or when printing from SD is currently not fool proof thanks to firmware limitations regarding reliable tracking of the various ``E`` values and the currently selected tool ``T``. In order to fully implement this feature, the following improvements were also done:
    * New ``PositionUpdated`` event when OctoPrint receives a response to an ``M114`` position query.
    * Extended ``PrintPaused`` and ``PrintCancelled`` events with position data from ``M114`` position query on print interruption/end.
  * Added (optional) firmware auto detection. If enabled (which it is by default), OctoPrint will now send an ``M115`` to the printer on initial connection in order to try to figure out what kind of firmware it is. For FIRMWARE_NAME values containing "repetier" (case insensitive), all Repetier-specific flags will be set on the comm layer. For FIRMWARE_NAME values containing "reprapfirmware" (also case insensitive), all RepRapFirmware-specific flags will be set on the comm layer. For now no other handling will be performed.
  * Added safe mode flag ``--safe`` and config setting ``startOnceInSafeMode`` that disables all third party plugins when active. The config setting will automatically be removed from `config.yaml` after the server has started through successfully.
  * Added ``octoprint config`` CLI that allows easier manipulation of config.yaml entries from the command line. Example: ``octoprint config set --bool server.startOnceInSafeMode true``

### Improvements

  * [#1048](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1048) - Added "Last print time" to extended file information (see also [#1522](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1522))
  * [#1422](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1422) - Added option for post roll for timed timelapse to duplicate last frame instead of capturing new frames. That makes for a faster render at the cost of a still frame at the end of the rendered video. See also [#1553](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1553).
  * [#1551](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1551) - Allow to define a custom bounding box for valid printer head movements in the printer profile, to make print dimension check more flexible.
  * [#1583](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1583) - Strip invalid `pip` arguments from `pip uninstall` commands, if provided by the user as additional pip arguments.
  * [#1593](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1593) - Automatically migrate old manual system commands for restarting OctoPrint and rebooting or shutting down the server to the new system wide configuration settings. Make a backup copy of the old `config.yaml` before doing so in case a manual rollback is required.
  * New central configuration option for commands to restart OctoPrint and to restart and shut down the system OctoPrint is running on. This allows plugins (like the Software Update Plugin or the Plugin Manager) and core functionality to perform these common administrative tasks without the user needing to define everything redundantly.
  * `pip` helper now adjusts `pip install` parameters corresponding to detected `pip` version:
    * Removes `--process-dependency-links` when it's not needed
    * Adds `--no-use-wheel` when it's needed
    * Detects and reports on completely broken versions
  * Better tracking of printer connection state for plugins and scripts:
    * Introduced three new Events `Connecting`, `Disconnecting` and `PrinterStateChanged`.
    * Introduced new GCODE script `beforePrinterDisconnected` which will get sent before a (controlled) disconnect from the printer. This can be used to send some final commands to the printer before the connection goes down, e.g. `M117 Bye from OctoPrint`.
    * The communication layer will now wait for the send queue to be fully processed before disconnecting from the printer for good. This way it is ensured that the `beforePrinterDisconnected` script or any further GCODE injected into it will actually get sent.
  * Additional baud rates to allow for connecting can now be specified along side additional serial ports via the settings dialog and the configuration file.
  * Option to never send checksums (e.g. if the printer firmware doesn't support it), see [#949](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/949).
  * Added secondary temperature polling interval to use when printer is not printing but a target temperature is set - this way the graph should be more responsive while monitoring a manual heatup.
  * Test buttons for webcam snapshot & stream URL, ffmpeg path and some other settings (see also [#183](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/183)).
  * Temperature graph automatically adjusts its Y axis range if necessary to accomodate the plotted data (see also [#632](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/632)).
  * "Fan on" command now always sends `S255` parameter for better compatibility across firmwares.
  * Warn users with a notification if a file is selected for printing that exceeds the current print volume (if the corresponding model data is available, see also [#1254](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1254))
  * Added option to also display temperatures in Fahrenheit (see also [#1258] (https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1258))
  * Better error message when the ``config.yaml`` file is invalid during startup
  * API now also allows issuing absolute jogging commands to the printer
  * Printer profile editor dialog refactored to better structure fields and explain where they are used
  * Option to detect z-hops during z-based timelapses and not trigger a snapshot (see also [1148](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1148))
  * File rename, move and copy functionality exposed via API, not yet utilized in stock frontend but available in [file manager plugin](https://github.com/Salandora/OctoPrint-FileManager).
  * Try to assure a sound SSL environment for the process at all times
  * Improved caching:
    * Main page and asset files now carry proper ``ETag`` and ``Last-Modified`` headers to allow for sensible browser-side caching
    * API sets ``Etag`` and/or ``Last-Modified`` headers on responses to GET requests where possible and feasible to allow for sensible browser-side caching
  * Renamed ``GcodeFilesViewModel`` to ``FilesViewModel`` - plugin authors should accordingly update their dependencies from ``gcodeFilesViewModel`` to ``filesViewModel``. Using the old name still works, but will log a warning and stop working with 1.4.x.
  * Make sure ``volume.depth`` for circular beds is forced to ``volume.width`` in printer profiles
  * Support for `M116`
  * Support ``M114`` responses without whitespace between coordinates (protocol consistency - who needs it?).
  * `M600` is now marked as a long running command by default.
  * Don't focus files in the file list after deleting a file - made the list too jumpy.
  * Cura plugin: "Test" button to check if path to cura engine is valid.
  * Cura plugin: Wizard component for configuring the path to the CuraEngine binary and for importing the first slicing profile
  * GCODE viewer: Added Layer Up/Down buttons (see also [#1306] (https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1306))
  * GCODE viewer: Allow cycling through layer via keyboard (up, down, pgup, pgdown)
  * GCODE viewer: Allow changing size thresholds via settings menu (see also [#1308](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1308))
  * GCODE viewer: Added support for GCODE arc commands (see also [#1382](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1382))
  * Language packs: Limit upload dialog for language pack archives to .zip, .tar.gz, .tgz and .tar extensions.
  * Plugin Manager: Adjusted to utilize new `pip` helper
  * Plugin Manager: Show restart button on install/uninstall notification if restart command is configured and a restart is required
  * Plugin Manager: Track managable vs not managable plugins
  * Plugin Manager: Allow hiding plugins from Plugin Manager via ``config.yaml``.
  * Plugin Manager: Limit upload dialog for plugin archives to .zip, .tar.gz, .tgz and .tar extensions.
  * Plugin Manager: Allow closing of all notifications and close them automatically on detected server disconnect. No need to keep a "Restart needed" message around if a restart is in progress.
  * Software Update plugin: More verbose output for logged in administrators. Will now log the update commands and their output similar to the Plugin Manager install and uninstall dialog.
  * Software Update plugin: CLI for checking for and applying updates
  * Software Update plugin: Wizard component for configuring OctoPrint's update mechanism
  * Software Update plugin: "busy" spinner on check buttons while already checking for updates.
  * Software Update plugin: Prevent update notification when wizard is open.
  * Plugin Manager / Software Update plugin: The "There's a new version of pip" message during plugin installs and software updates is no longer displayed like an error.
  * Plugin Manager / Software Update plugin: The "busy" dialog can no longer be closed accidentally.
  * Timelapse: Better (& earlier) reporting to the user when something's up with the snapshot URL causing issues with capturing timelapse frames and hence making it impossible to render a timelapse movie on print completion.
  * Virtual printer: Usage screen for the ``!!DEBUG`` commands on ``!!DEBUG``, ``!!DEBUG:help`` or ``!!DEBUG:?``
  * Updated frontend dependencies (possibly relevant for plugin authors):
    * Bootstrap to 2.3.2
    * JQuery to 2.2.4
    * Lodash to 3.10.1
    * SockJS to 1.1.1
  * Better error resilience against errors in UI components.
  * Various improvements in the GCODE interpreter which performs the GCODE analysis
  * Various adjustments towards Python 3 compatibility (still a work in progress though, see also [#1411](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1411), [#1412](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1412), [#1413](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1413), [#1414](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1414))
  * Various code refactorings
  * Various small UI improvements
  * Various documentation improvements

### Bug fixes

  * [#1047](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1047) - Fixed 90 degree webcam rotation for iOS Safari.
  * [#1148](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1148) - Fixed retraction z hop setting for Z-triggered timelapses. Was not correctly propagated to the backend and hence not taking effect.
  * [#1567](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1567) - Invalidate ``/api/settings`` cache on change of the user's login state (include user roles into ETag calculation).
  * [#1586](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1586) - Fixed incompatibility of update script and command line helper with non-ASCII output from called commands.
  * [#1588](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1588) - Fixed feedback controls again.
  * [#1599](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1599) - Properly handle exceptions that arise within the update script during runtime.
  * It's not possible anymore to select files that are not machinecode files (e.g. GCODE) for printing on the file API.
  * Changes to a user's personal settings via the UI now propagate across sessions.
  * Improved compatibility of webcam rotation CSS across newer browsers (see also [#1436](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1436))
  * Fix for system menu not getting properly reloaded after entries changed
  * Invalidate ``/api/settings`` cache on change of the currently enabled plugins (by including plugin names into ETag calculation) and/or on change of the current effective config.
  * Fix for `/api/settings` not being properly invalidated for plugin settings that do not have a representation in `config.yaml` but are only added at runtime (and hence are not captured by `config.effective`).
  * Invalidate ``/api/timelapse`` cache on change of the current timelapse configuration.
  * Fixed an issue causing the version number not to be properly extracted from ``sdist`` tarballs generated under Windows.
  * Get rid of double scroll bar in printer profile editor.

  * Fixed select & print not working anymore for SD files thanks to a timing issue.
  * Fixed ``PrintFailed`` event payload (was still missing new folder relevant data).
  * Fixed premature parse stop on ``M114`` and ``M115`` responses with ``ok``-prefix.
  * Make sure `?l10n` request parameter gets also propagated to API calls as `X-Locale` header in case of locale sensitive API responses.
  * Fix language mixture due to cached template configs including localized strings; cache per locale.
  * Only insert divider in system menu after core commands if there are custom commands.
  * Fix update of webcam stream URL not being applied due to caching.
  * Fixed a rare race condition causing the new "The settings changed, reload?" popup to show up even when the settings change originated in the same client instance.
  * Fixed a bunch of missing translations.
  * Pinned Tornado version to 4.0.2. Former version requirement was able to pull in a beta version causing issues with websockets due to a bug in `permessage-deflate` handling. The Tornado requirement needs an update, but we'll leave it at 4.0.2 for 1.3.0 since we'll need to do some migration work for compatibility with anything newer. Potentially related to [#1523](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1523).
  * Fix a rare race condition in the command line helper and the update script that could cause the code to hang due to waiting on an event that would never be set.
  * Fix issue with handling new settings substructures when they are compared to existing settings data in order to find the structural diff.
  * Fix for the temperature graph not displaying the data history on site reload.

    * [1.3.0rc2](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.0rc2)
    * [1.3.0rc3](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.0rc3)

## 1.2.18 (2016-11-30)

### Improvements

  * Allow arbitrary frame rates for creating timelapses. Before, the entered fps value was also directly used as frame rate for the actual video, which could cause problems with any frame rates not specified in the MPEG2 standard. Now OctoPrint will use a standard frame rate for the rendered video and render the timelapse stills into the finished movie with the configured frame rate.
  * Limited Cura profile importer to `.ini` files and clarified the supported versions
  * Add support for the `R` parameter for `M109` and `M190`

### Bug fixes

  * [#1541](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1541) - Fix selecting the printer profile to use by default
  * [#1543](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1543) - Fix target temperature propagation from communication layer
  * [#1567](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1567) - Fix issue with restricted settings getting parsed to the wrong data structure in the frontend if loaded anonymously first.
  * [#1571](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1571) - Fix parsing of port number from HTTP Host header for IPv6 addresses
  * Fix issue with settings restriction causing internal settings defaults to be changed.

    * [1.2.18rc1](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.18rc1)

## 1.2.17 (2016-11-08)

### Improvements

  * Files like `config.yaml` etc will now persist their permissions, with a lower and upper permission bounds for sanitization (e.g. removing executable flags on configuration files but keeping group read/write permissions if found).
  * Log full stack trace on socket connection errors when debug logging for `octoprint.server.util.sockjs` is enabled
  * ``SettingsPlugin``s may now mark configuration paths as restricted so that they are not returned on the REST API
  * Updated LESS.js version
  * Improved the `serial.log` logging handler to roll over serial log on new connections to the printer instead of continuously appending to the same file. Please note that `serial.log` is a debugging tool only and should *not* be left enabled unless you are trying to troubleshoot something in your printer communication.
  * Split JS/CSS/LESS asset bundles according into asset bundles for core + bundled plugins ("packed_core.{js|css|less}") and third party plugins ("packed_plugins.{js|css|less}"). That will allow the core UI to still function properly even if an installed third party plugin produces invalid JS and therefore causes a parser error for the whole plugin JS file. See [#1544](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1544) for an example of such a situation.

### Bug fixes

  * [#1531](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1531) - Fixed encoding bug in HTTP request processing triggered by content type headers on form data fields
  * Fixed forced `config.yaml` save on startup caused by mistakenly assuming that printer parameters were always migrated.
  * Fixed issue causing ``remember_me`` cookie not to be deleted properly on logout
  * Fixed broken filter toggling on ``ItemListHelper`` class used for various lists throughout the web interface
  * Fixed an issue with the preliminary page never reporting that the server is now up if the page generated during preliminary caching had no cache headers set (e.g. because it contained the first run setup wizard)
  * Fixed a bug causing the update of OctoPrint to not work under certain circumstances: If 1.2.16 was installed and the settings were *never* saved via the "Settings" dialog's "Save", the update of OctoPrint would fail due to a `KeyError` in the updater. Reason is a renamed property, properly switched to when saving the settings.
  * Fixed the logging subsystem to properly clean up after itself.
  * Fixed a wrong order in loading JS files on the client introduced in 1.2.17rc2 to make the UI more resilient against broken plugin JS.
  * Properly handle empty JS file list from plugins. Solves a 500 on OctoPrint instances without any third party plugins installed generated during web asset bundling introduced in 1.2.17rc2.

## 1.2.16 (2016-09-23)

### Improvements

  * [#1434](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1434): Make sure to sanitize any file names in the upload folder that do not match OctoPrint's file name "sanitization standard" automatically when creating a file listing. This should solve issues with UI functionality like selecting a file for printing or deleting a file to not work with files that were uploaded manually to the ``uploads`` folder. As a side note: Please don't do this, use the ``watched`` folder if you want to SCP/FTP/copy files directly to OctoPrint.
  * [#1434](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1434): Allow `[` and `]` in uploaded file names.
  * [#1481](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1481): Bring back non-fuzzy layer time estimates in the GCODE viewer.
  * Improved fuzzy print time displays in the frontend. Rounding now takes overall duration into account - durations over a day will be rounded up/down to half days, durations over an hour will be rounded up/down to half hours, durations over 30min will be rounded to 10min segments, durations below 30min will be rounded up or down to the next minute depending on the seconds and finally if we are talking about less than a minute, durations over 30s will return "less than a minute", durations under 30s will return "a couple of seconds".
  * Improved intermediary loading page: Don't report server as ready and reload until preliminary caching has been done, IF preliminary caching will be done.
  * Added release channels to OctoPrint's bundled Software Update plugin. You will now be able to subscribe to OctoPrint's `maintenance` or `devel` release candidates in addition to stable versions. [Read more about Release Channels on the wiki](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Using-Release-Channels).
  * Return a "400 Bad Request" instead of a "500 Internal Server Error" if a `multipart/form-data` request (e.g. a file upload) is sent which lacks the `boundary` field.

### Bug Fixes

  * [#1448](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1448): Don't "eat" first line of the pause script after a pause triggering `M0` but send it to the printer instead
  * [#1477](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1477): Only report files enqueued for analysis which actually are (as in, don't claim to have queued STL files for GCODE analysis)
  * [#1478](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1478): Don't display inaccurate linear estimate ("6 days remaining") until 30 *minutes* have passed, even if nothing else is available. Potentially related to [#1428](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1428).
  * [#1479](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1479): Make sure set cookies are post fixed with a port specific suffix and that the path they are set on takes the script root from the request into account.
  * [#1483](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1483): Filenames in file uploads may also now be encoded in ISO-8859-1, as defined in [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.4). Solves an issue when sending files with non-ASCII-characters in the file name from Slic3r.
  * [#1491](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1491): Fixed generate/delete API key in the user settings
  * [#1492](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1492): Fixed a bug in the software update plugin depending on the presence of the ``prerelease`` flag which is only present when added manually or using a non stable release channel.

    * [1.2.16rc2](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.16rc2)

## 1.2.15 (2016-07-30)

### Improvements

  * [#1425](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1425) - Added a compatibility work around for plugins implementing the [`octoprint.comm.transport.serial_factory` hook](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-comm-transport-serial-factory) but whose handler's `write` method did not return the number of written bytes (e.g. [GPX plugin including v2.5.2](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/gpx/), [M33 Fio plugin including v1.2](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/m33fio/)).

### Bug Fixes

  * [#1423](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1423) - Fixed an issue with certain printers dropping or garbling communication when setting the read timeout of the serial line. Removed the dynamic timeout setting introduced by [#1409](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1409) to solve this.
  * [#1425](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1425) - Fixed an error when trying to close a printer connection that had not yet been opened and was `None`
  * Fixed "Last Modified" header calculation for views where only one source file was present

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.14...1.2.15))

## 1.2.14 (2016-07-28)

### Improvements

  * [#935](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/935) - Support alternative source file types and target extensions in [SlicerPlugins](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/mixins.html#slicerplugin).
  * [#1393](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1393) - Added dedicated sub commands on the job API to pause and resume a print job (instead of only offering a toggle option).
  * Better "upload error" message with a list of supported extensions (instead of hardcoded ones)
  * Use fuzzy times for print time estimation from GCODE analysis
  * Allow M23 "File opened" response with no filename (RepRapPro)
  * Allow intermediary startup page to forward query parameters and fragments from initial call to actual web frontend
  * More error resilience when rendering templates (e.g. from plugins)
  * Make sure that all bytes of a line to send to the printer have actually been sent
  * "Tickle" printer when encountering a communication timeout while idle
  * Report `CLOSED`/`CLOSED_WITH_ERROR` states as "Offline" in frontend for more consistency with startup `NONE` state which already was reported as "Offline"
  * Another attempt at a saner print time estimation: Force linear (way less accurate) estimate if calculation of more accurate version takes too long, sanity check calculated estimate and use linear estimate if it looks wrong, improved threshold values for calculation. Read [the second half of this post on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/octoprint/WWpm1FCUkAs/X3HomTM5DgAJ) on why accurate print time estimation is so difficult to achieve.
  * Display print job progress percentage on progress bar.
  * Added an indicator for print time left prediction accuracy and explanation of its origin as tooltip.
  * Improved visual distinction of "State" sidebar panel info clusters.

### Bug Fixes

  * [#1385](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1385) - Send all non-protocol messages from printer to clients.
  * [#1388](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1388) - Track consecutive timeouts even when idle and disconnect from printer when it's not responding any longer.
  * [#1391](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1391) - Only use the first value from the X-Scheme header for the reverse proxy setup. Otherwise there could be problems when multiple reverse proxies were configured chained together, each adding their own header to the mix.
  * [#1407](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1407) - If a file is uploaded with the "print" flag set to true, make sure to clear that flag after the print job has been triggered so that now all following uploaded or selected files will start printing on their own.
  * [#1409](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1409) - Don't report a communication timeout after a heatup triggered by a print from SD.
  * Fixed scrolling to freshly uploaded files, also now highlighting the file entry for better visibility.
  * Fixed overeager preemptive caching of invalid protocols.
  * Fix modal background of update confirmation not vanishing
  * Ensure log entries and messages from printer are sent to frontend already converted to utf-8. Otherwise even one line in the log that can't be converted automatically without error can cause updates from the backend to not arrive.
  * Report correct printer state including error strings even after disconnecting
  * While printing, be sure to read the next line from file and send that if the current line was filtered
  * Small fixes in the GCODE analysis
  * Small fixes in the documentation

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.13...1.2.14))

## 1.2.13 (2016-06-16)

### Bug Fixes

  * [#1373](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1373): Don't parse `B:` as bed temperature when it shows up as part of a position report from `M114`.
  * [#1374](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1374): Don't try to perform a passive login when the components we'd need to inform about a change in login state aren't yet available. Solves a bug that lead - among other things - to the Plugin Manager and the Software Update Plugin not showing anything but misleading errors until the user logged out and back in.
  * Fixed the temperature graph staying uninitialized until a connection to a printer was established.
  * Fixed an error causing issues during frontend startup if the browser doesn't support tracking browser visibility.
  * Fixed an error causing issues during frontend startup if the browser doesn't support the capabilities needed for the GCODE viewer.

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.12...1.2.13))

## 1.2.12 (2016-06-09)

### Improvements

  * [#1338](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1338): Threshold configuration fields now include information about how to specify the thresholds.
  * Mark unrendered timelapses currently being processed (recording or rendering) in the list and remove action buttons so no accidental double-processing can take place.
  * Removed file extension from "rendering" and "rendered" notifications, was misleading when using the [mp4 wrapper script](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/184).
  * Added some new events for manipulation of slicing profiles.
  * Small fix of the german translation.

### Bug Fixes

  * [#1314](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1314): Do not change the extension of `.g` files being uploaded to SD (e.g. `auto0.g`)
  * [#1320](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1320): Allow deletion of *.mp4 timelapse files (see [this wrapper script](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/184)).
  * [#1324](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1324): Make daemonized OctoPrint properly clean up its pid file again (see also [#1330](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1330)).
  * [#1326](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1326): Do not try to clean up an unrendered timelapse while it is already being deleted (and produce way too much logging output in the process).
  * [#1343](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1343): Events are now processed in the order they are fired in, making e.g. the "timelapse rendering" message always appear before "timelapse failed" and hence not stay on forever in case of a failed timelapse.
  * [#1344](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1344): `ProgressPlugin`s now get also notified about a progress of 0%.
  * [#1357](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1357): Fixed wrongly named method call on editing access control options for a user, causing that to not work properly.
  * [#1361](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1361): Properly reload profile list for currently selected slicer in the slicing dialog on change of profiles.
  * [#1364](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1364): Fixed a race condition that could cause the UI to not initialize correctly due to 401 errors, leaving it in an unusable state until a reload.
  * Fixed concurrent message pushing to the frontend being able to break push messages for the session by forcing synchronization of SockJS message sending.
  * Do not require admin rights for connecting/disconnecting, like it was in 1.1.x (note that this is supposed to become configurable behaviour once [#1110](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1110) gets implemented)

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.11...1.2.12))

## 1.2.11 (2016-05-04)

### Important Announcement

Due to a recent change in the financial situation of the project, the funding of OctoPrint is at stake. If you love OctoPrint and want to see its development continue at the pace of the past two years, please read on about its current funding situation and how you can help: ["I need your support"](http://octoprint.org/blog/2016/04/13/i-need-your-support/).

### Improvements

  * Added option to treat resend requests as `ok` for such firmwares that do not send an `ok` after requesting a resend. If you printer communication gets stalled after a resend request from the firmware, try checking this option.
  * Added an "About" dialog to properly inform about OctoPrint's license, contributors and supporters.
  * Added a announcement plugin that utilizes the RSS feeds of the [OctoPrint Blog](http://octoprint.org/blog/) and the [plugin repository](http://plugins.octoprint.org) to display news to the user. By default only the "important announcement" category is enabled. This category will only be used for very rare situations such as making you aware of critical updates or important news. You can enable further categories (with more announcements to be expected) in the plugin's settings dialog.

### Bug Fixes

  * [#1300](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1300) - Removed possibility to accidentally disabling local file list by first limiting view to files from SD and then disabling SD support.
  * [#1315](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1315) - Fixed broken post roll on z-based timelapses.
  * Fixed CSS data binding syntax on the download link in the files list
  * Changed control distance from jQuery data into a knockout observerable and observerableArray
  * Allow an unauthorized user to logout from a logedin interface state

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.10...1.2.11))

## 1.2.10 (2016-03-16)

### Improvements

  * Improved performance of console output during plugin installation/deinstallation
  * Slight performance improvements in the communication layer
  * Log small log excerpt to `octoprint.log` upon encountering a communication error.
  * Changed wording in "firmware error" notifications to better reflect that there was an error while communicating with the printer, since the error condition can also be triggered by serial errors while trying to establish a connection to the printer or when already connected.
  * Support downloading ".mp4" timelapse files. You'll need a [custom wrapper script for timelapse rendering](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/184) for this to be relevant to you. See also [#1255](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1255)
  * The communication layer will now wait up to 10s after clicking disconnect in order to send any left-over lines from its buffers.
  * Moved less commonly used configuration options in Serial settings into "Advanced options" roll-out.

### Bug Fixes

  * [#1224](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1224) - Fixed an issue introduced by the fix for [#1196](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1196) that had the "Upload to SD" button stop working correctly.
  * [#1226](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1226) - Fixed an issue causing an error on disconnect after or cancelling of an SD print, caused by the unsuccessful attempt to record print recovery data for the file on the printer's SD card.
  * [#1268](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1268) - Only add bed temperature line to temperature management specific start gcode in CuraEngine invocation if a bed temperature is actually set in the slicing profile.
  * [#1271](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1271) - If a communication timeout occurs during an active resend request, OctoPrint will now not send an `M105` with an increased line number anymore but repeat the last resent command instead.
  * [#1272](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1272) - Don't add an extra `ok` for `M28` response.
  * [#1273](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1273) - Add an extra `ok` for `M29` response, but only if configured such in "Settings" > "Serial" > "Advanced options" > "Generate additional ok for M29"
  * [#1274](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1274) - Trigger `M20` only once after finishing uploading to SD
  * [#1275](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1275) - Prevent `M105` "cascade" due to communication timeouts
  * Fixed wrong tracking of extruder heating up for `M109 Tn` commands in multi-extruder setups.
  * Fixed start of SD file uploads not sending an `M110`.
  * Fixed job data not being reset when disconnecting while printing.

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.9...1.2.10))

## 1.2.9 (2016-02-10)

### Improvements

  * [#318](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/318) - Snapshots for timelapses are now named in a non-colliding, job-based way, allowing a new timelapse to start while the other is still being rendered (although printing with an active timelapse rendering job is not recommended and will be solved with a proper render job queue in a later version). Timelapses that were not successfully rendered are kept for 7 days (configurable, although not via the UI so far) and can be manually rendered or deleted through a new UI component within the timelapse tab that shows up if unrendered timelapses are detected.
  * [#485](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/485) - "Timelapse rendering" notification is now persistent, even across reloads/client switches. That should make it easier to see that a rendering job is currently in progress.
  * [#939](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/939) - Updated to Knockout 3.4.0
  * [#1204](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1204) - Display total print time as estimated by GCODE viewer on GCODE viewer tab. That will allow access to an estimate even if the server hadn't yet calculated that when a print started. Note that due to slightly different implementation server and client side the resulting estimate might differ.
  * OctoPrint now serves an intermediary page upon start that informs the user about the server still starting up. Once the server is detected as running, the page automatically switches to the standard interface.
  * OctoPrint now displays a link to the release notes of an updated component in the update notification, the update confirmation and the version overview in the settings dialog. Please always make sure to at least skim over the release notes for new OctoPrint releases, they might contain important information that you need to know before updating.
  * Improved initial page loading speeds by introducing a preemptive cache. OctoPrint will now record how you access it and on server start pre-render the page so it's ideally available in the server-side cache when you try to access it.
  * Initialize login user name and password with an empty string and clear both on successful login (see [#1175](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1175)).
  * Added a "Refresh" button to the file list for people who modify the stored files externally (doing this is not encouraged however due to reasons of book keeping, e.g. metadata tracking etc).
  * "Save" button on settings dialog is now disabled while background tasks (getting or receiving config data from the backend) are in progress.
  * Improved performance of terminal tab on lower powered clients. Adaptive rate limiting now ensures the server backs off with log updates if the client can't process them fast enough. If the client is really slow, log updates get disabled automatically during printing. This behaviour can be disabled with override buttons in the terminal tab's advanced options if necessary.
  * Added option to ignore any unhandled errors reported by the firmware and another option to only cancel ongoing prints on unhandled errors from the firmware (instead of instant disconnect that so far was the default).
  * Made version compatibility check PEP440 compliant (important for plugin authors).
  * Do not hiccup on manually sent `M28` commands.
  * Persist print recovery data on print failures (origin and name of printed file, position in file when print was aborted, time and date of print failure). Currently this data isn't used anywhere, but it [can be accessed from plugins in order to add recovery functionality](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint-PrintRecoveryPoc) to OctoPrint.
  * Small performance improvements in update checks.
  * The file upload dialog will now only display files having an extension that's supported for upload (if the browser supports it, also see [#1196](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1196)).

### Bug Fixes

  * [#1007](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1007) - Don't enable the "Print" button if no print job is selected.
  * [#1181](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1181) - Properly slugify UTF-8 only file names.
  * [#1196](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1196) - Do not show drag-n-drop overlay if server is offline.
  * [#1208](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1208) - Fixed `retraction_combing` profile setting being incorrectly used by bundled Cura plugin (see [#1209](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1209))
  * Fixed OctoPrint compatibility check in the plugin manager, could report `False` for development versions against certain versions of Python's `setuptools` (thanks to @ignaworm who stumbled over this).
  * Fixed a missing parameter in `PluginSettings.remove` call (see [#1177](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1177)).
  * Docs: Fixed the example for a custom `M114` control to also match negative coordinates.
  * Reset scroll position in settings dialog properly when re-opening it or switching tabs.
  * Fixed an issue that prevented system menu entries that were added to a so far empty system menu make the menu show up.
  * Fixed an issue that made requests to restricted resources fail even though the first run wizard had been completed successfully.
  * Fixed an issue where an unknown command or the suppression of a command could cause the communication to stall until a communication timeout was triggered.
  * Strip [unwanted ANSI characters](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3418) from output produced by pip versions 8.0.0, 8.0.1 and 8.0.3 that prevents our plugin installation detection from working correctly.

## 1.2.8 (2015-12-07)

### Notes for Upgraders

#### A bug in 1.2.7 prevents directly updating to 1.2.8, here's what to do

A bug in OctoPrint 1.2.7 (fixed in 1.2.8) prevents updating OctoPrint to version
1.2.8. If you try to perform the update, you will simply be told that "the update
was successful", but the update won't actually have taken place. To solve this
hen-egg-problem, a plugin has been made available that fixes said bug (through
monkey patching).

The plugin is called "Updatefix 1.2.7" and can be found
[in the plugin repository](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/updatefix127/)
and [on Github](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-Updatefix-1.2.7/).

Before attempting to update your installation from version 1.2.7 to version 1.2.8,
please install the plugin via your plugin manager and restart your server. Note that
you will only see it in the Plugin Manager if you need it, since it's only compatible with
OctoPrint version 1.2.7. After you installed the plugin and restarted your server
you can update as usual. The plugin will self-uninstall once it detects that it's
running under OctoPrint 1.2.8. After the self-uninstall another restart of your server
will be triggered (if you have setup your server's restart command, defaults to
`sudo service octoprint restart` on OctoPi) in order to really get rid of any
left-overs, so don't be alarmed when that happens, it is intentional.

**If you cannot or don't want to use the plugin**, alternatively you can switch
OctoPrint to "Commit" based tracking via the settings of the Software Update plugin,
update, then switch back to "Release" based tracking (see [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/wvkgiGJ.png)).

#### Bed temperatures are now only displayed if printer profile has a heated bed configured

This release fixes a [bug](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1125)
that caused bed temperature display and controls to be available even if the
selected printer profile didn't have a heated bed configured.

If your printer does have a heated bed but you are not seeing its temperature
in the "Temperature" tab after updating to 1.2.8, please make sure to check
the "Heated Bed" option in your printer profile (under Settings > Printer Profiles)
as shown [in this short GIF](http://i.imgur.com/wp1j9bs.gif).

### Improvements

  * Version numbering now follows [PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/).
  * Prepared some things for publishing OctoPrint on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
    in the future.
  * [BlueprintPlugin mixin](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/mixins.html#blueprintplugin)
    now has an `errorhandler` decorator that serves the same purpose as
    [Flask's](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/errorpages/#error-handlers)
    ([#1059](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1059))
  * Interpret `M25` in a GCODE file that is being streamed from OctoPrint as
    indication to pause, like `M0` and `M1`.
  * Cache rendered page and translation files indefinitely. That should
    significantly improve performance on reloads of the web interface.
  * Added the string "unknown command" to the list of ignored printer errors.
    This should help with general firmware compatibility in case a firmware
    lacks features.
  * Added the strings "cannot open" and "cannot enter" to the list of ignored
    printer errors. Those are errors that Marlin may report if there is an issue
    with the printer's SD card.
  * The "CuraEngine" plugin now makes it more obvious that it only targets
    CuraEngine versions up to and including 15.04 and also links to the plugin's
    homepage with more information right within the settings dialog.
  * Browser tab visibility is now tracked by the web interface, disabling the
    webcam and the GCODE viewer if the tab containing OctoPrint is not active.
    That should reduce the amount of resource utilized by the web interface on
    the client when it is not actively monitored. Might also help to mitigate
    [#1065](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1065), the final verdict
    on that one is still out though.
  * The printer log in the terminal tab will now be cut off after 3000 lines
    even if autoscroll is disabled. If the limit is reached, no more log lines
    will be added to the client's buffer. That ensures that the log will not
    scroll and the current log excerpt will stay put while also not causing
    the browser to run into memory errors due to trying to buffer an endless
    amount of log lines.
  * Increased timeout of "waiting for restart" after an update from 20 to 60sec
    (20sec turned out to be too little for OctoPi for whatever reason).
  * Added a couple of unit tests

### Bug Fixes

 * [#1120](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1120) - Made the watchdog
   that monitors and handles the `watched` folder more resilient towards errors.
 * [#1125](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1125) - Fixed OctoPrint
   displaying bed temperature and controls and allowing the sending of GCODE
   commands targeting the bed (`M140`, `M190`) if the printer profile doesn't
   have a heated bed configured.
 * Fixed an issue that stopped the software updater working for OctoPrint. The
   updater reports success updating, but no update has actually taken place. A
   fix can be applied for this issue to OctoPrint version 1.2.7 via
   [the Updatefix 1.2.7 plugin](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-Updatefix-1.2.7).
   For more information please refer to the [Important information for people updating from version 1.2.7](#important-information-for-people-updating-from-version-127)
   above.
 * Fix: Current filename in job data should never be prefixed with `/`
 * Only persist plugin settings that differ from the defaults. This way the
   `config.yaml` won't be filled with lots of redundant data. It's the
   responsibility of the plugin authors to responsibly handle changes in default
   settings of their plugins and add data migration where necessary.
 * Fixed a documentation bug ([#1067](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1067))
 * Fixed a conflict with bootstrap-responsive, e.g. when using the
   [ScreenSquish Plugin](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/screensquish/)
   ([#1103](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1067))
 * Fixed OctoPrint still sending SD card related commands to the printer even
   if SD card support is disabled (e.g. `M21`).
 * Hidden files are no longer visible to the template engine, neither as (GCODE)
   scripts nor as interface templates.
 * The hostname and URL prefix via which the OctoPrint web interface is accessed
   is now part of the cache key. Without that being the case the cache could
   be created referring to something like `/octoprint/prefix/api/` for its API
   endpoint (if accessed via `http://somehost:someport/octoprint/prefix/` first
   time), which would then cause the interface to not work if accessed later
   via another route (e.g. `http://someotherhost/`).
 * Fixed a JavaScript error on finishing streaming of a file to SD.
 * Fixed version reporting on detached HEADs (when the branch detection
   reported "HEAD" instead of "(detached"
 * Fixed some path checks for systems with symlinked paths
   ([#1051](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1051))
 * Fixed a bug causing the "Server Offline" overlay to pop _under_ the
   "Please reload" overlay, which could lead to "Connection refused" browser
   messages when clicking "Reload now" in the wrong moment.

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.7...1.2.8))

## 1.2.7 (2015-10-20)

### Improvements

  * [#1062](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1062) - Plugin Manager
    now has a configuration dialog that among other things allows defining the
    used `pip` command if auto detection proves to be insufficient here.
  * Allow defining additional `pip` parameters in Plugin Manager. That might
    make `sudo`-less installation of plugins possible in situations where it's
    tricky otherwise.
  * Improved timelapse processing (backported from `devel` branch):
    * Individually captured frames cannot "overtake" each other anymore through
      usage of a capture queue.
    * Notifications will now be shown when the capturing of the timelapse's
      post roll happens, including an approximation of how long that will take.
    * Usage of `requests` instead of `urllib` for fetching the snapshot,
      appears to also have [positive effects on webcam compatibility](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1078).
  * Some more defensive escaping for various settings in the UI (e.g. webcam URL)
  * Switch to more error resilient saving of configuration files and other files
    modified during runtime (save to temporary file & move). Should reduce risk
    of file corruption.
  * Downloading GCODE and STL files should now set more fitting `Content-Type`
    headers (`text/plain` and `application/sla`) for better client side support
    for "Open with" like usage scenarios.
  * Selecting z-triggered timelapse mode will now inform about that not working
    when printing from SD card.
  * Software Update Plugin: Removed "The web interface will now be reloaded"
    notification after successful update since that became obsolete with
    introduction of the "Reload Now" overlay.
  * Updated required version of `psutil` and `netifaces` dependencies.

### Bug Fixes

  * [#1057](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1057) - Better error
    resilience of the Software Update plugin against broken/incomplete update
    configurations.
  * [#1075](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1075) - Fixed support
    of `sudo` for installing plugins, but added big visible warning about it
    as it's **not** recommended.
  * [#1077](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1077) - Do not hiccup
    on [UTF-8 BOMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) (or other
    BOMs for that matter) at the beginning of GCODE files.
  * Fixed an issue that caused user sessions to not be properly associated,
    leading to Sessions getting duplicated, wrongly saved etc.
  * Fixed internal server error (HTTP 500) response on REST API calls with
    unset `Content-Type` header.
  * Fixed an issue leading to drag-and-drop file uploads to trigger frontend
    processing in various other file upload widgets.
  * Fixed a documentation error.
  * Fixed caching behaviour on GCODE/STL downloads, was setting the `ETag`
    header improperly.
  * Fixed GCODE viewer not properly detecting change of currently visualized
    file on Windows systems.

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.6...1.2.7))

## 1.2.6 (2015-09-02)

### Improvements

  * Added support for version reporting on detached checkouts
    (see [#1041](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1041))

### Bug Fixes

  * Pinned requirement for [psutil](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil)
    dependency to version 3.1.1 of that library due to an issue when
    installing version 3.2.0 of that library released on 2015-09-02 through
    a `python setup.py install` on OctoPrint. Also pinned all other requirements
    to definitive versions that definitely work while at it to keep that from
    happening again.

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.5...1.2.6))

## 1.2.5 (2015-08-31)

### Improvements

  * [#986](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/986) - Added tooltip for
    "additional data" button in file list.
  * [#1028](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1028) - Hint about why
    timelapse configuration is disabled.
  * New central configuration option for commands to restart OctoPrint and to
    restart and shut down the system OctoPrint is running on. This allows plugins
    (like the Software Update Plugin or the Plugin Manager) and core functionality
    to perform these common administrative tasks without the user needing to define
    everything redundantly.
  * Settings dialog now visualizes when settings are saving and when they being
    retrieved. Also the Send/Cancel buttons are disabled while settings are saving
    to prevent duplicated requests and concurrent retrieval of the settings by
    multiple viewmodels is disabled as well.
  * Better protection against rendering errors from templates provided by third
    party plugins.
  * Better protection against corrupting the configuration by using a temporary
    file as intermediate buffer.
  * Added warning to UI regarding Z timelapses and spiralized objects.
  * Better compatibility with Repetier firmware:
    * Added "Format Error" to whitelisted recoverable communication errors
      (see also [#1032](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1032)).
    * Added option to ignore repeated resend requests for the same line (see
      also discussion in [#1015](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1015)).
  * Software Update Plugin:
    * Adjusted to utilize new centralized restart commands (see above).
    * Allow configuration of checkout folder and version tracking type via
      Plugin Configuration.
    * Display message to user if OctoPrint's checkout folder is not configured
      or a non-release version is running and version tracking against releases
      is enabled.
    * Clear version cache when a change in the check configuration is detected.
    * Mark check configurations for which an update is not possible.
  * Made disk space running low a bit more obvious through visual warning on
    configurable thresholds.

### Bug Fixes

  * [#985](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/985) - Do not hiccup on
    unset `Content-Type` part headers for multipart file uploads.
  * [#1001](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1001) - Fixed connection
    tab not unfolding properly (see also [#1002](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1002)).
  * [#1012](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1012) - All API
    responses now set no-cache headers, making the Edge browser behave a bit better
  * [#1019](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1019) - Better error
    handling of problems when trying to write the webassets cache.
  * [#1021](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1021) - Properly handle
    serial close on Macs.
  * [#1031](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1031) - Special
    handling of `M112` (emergency stop) command:
    * Jump send queue
    * In case the printer's firmware doesn't understand it yet, at least
      shutdown all of the heaters
    * Disconnect
  * Properly reset job progress to 0% when restarting a previously completed
    printjob (see [#998](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/998)).
  * Report an update as failed if the `pip` command returns a return code that
    indicates failure.
  * Fixed sorting of templates: could only be sorted by name, individual
    configurations were ignored (see [#1022](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1022)).
  * Fixed positioning of custom context menus: were offset due to changes in
    overall positioning settings (see [#1023](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1023)).
  * Software Update: Don't use display version for comparison of git commit
    hashs.
  * Fixed temperature parsing for multi extruder setups.
  * Fixed nested vertical and horizontal custom control layouts.

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.4...1.2.5))

## 1.2.4 (2015-07-23)

### Improvements

  * `RepeatedTimer` now defaults to `daemon` set to `True`. This makes sure
    plugins using it don't have to remember to set that flag themselves in
    order for the server to properly shut down when timers are still active.
  * Fixed a typo in the docs about `logging.yaml` (top level element is
    `loggers`, not `logger`).
  * Support for plugins with external dependencies (`dependency_links` in
    setuptools), interesting for plugin authors who need to depend on Python
    libraries that are (not yet) available on PyPI.
  * Better resilience against errors within plugins.

### Bug Fixes

  * Do not cache web page when running for the first time, to avoid caching
    the first run dialog popup along side with it. This should solve issues
    people were having when configuring OctoPrint for the first time, then
    reloading the page without clearing the cache, being again prompted with
    the dialog with no chance to clear it.
  * Fix/workaround for occasional white panes in settings dialog on Safari 8,
    which appears to have an issue with fixed positioning.
  * Fixed form field truncation in upload requests that could lead to problems
    when trying to import Cura profiles with names longer than 28 characters.
  * Fixed webcam rotation for timelapse rendering.
  * Fixed user settings not reaching the editor in the frontend.
  * Notifications that are in process of being closed don't open again on
    mouse over (that was actually more of an unwanted feature).

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.3...1.2.4))

## 1.2.3 (2015-07-09)

### Improvements

  * New option to actively poll the watched folder. This should make it work also
    if it is mounted on a filesystem that doesn't allow getting notifications
    about added files through notification by the operating system (e.g.
    network shares).
  * Better resilience against senseless temperature/SD-status-polling intervals
    (such as 0).
  * Log exceptions during writing to the serial port to `octoprint.log`.

### Bug Fixes

  * [#961](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/961) - Fixed a JavaScript error that caused an error to be logged when "enter" was pressed in file or plugin search.
  * [#962](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/962) - ``url(...)``s in packed CSS and LESS files should now be rewritten properly too to refer to correct paths
  * Update notifications were not vanishing properly after updating:
    * Only use version cache for update notifications if the OctoPrint version still is the same to make sure the cache gets invalidated after an external update of OctoPrint.
    * Do not persist version information when saving settings of the Software Update plugin
  * Always delete files from the ``watched`` folder after importing then. Using file preprocessor plugins could lead to the files staying there.
  * Fixed an encoding problem causing OctoPrint's Plugin Manager and Software Update plugins to choke on UTF-8 characters in the update output.
  * Fixed sorting by file size in file list
  * More resilience against missing plugin assets:
    * Asset existence will now be checked before they get included
      in the assets to bundle by webassets, logging a warning if a
      file isn't present.
    * Monkey-patched webassets filter chain to not die when a file
      doesn't exist, but to log an error instead and just return
      an empty file instead.

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.2...1.2.3))

## 1.2.2 (2015-06-30)

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an admin-only security issue introduced in 1.2.0, updating is strongly advised.

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.1...1.2.2))

## 1.2.1 (2015-06-30)

### Improvements

* More flexibility when interpreting compatibility data from plugin repository. If compatibility information is provided
  only as a version number it's prefixed with `>=` for the check (so stating a compatibility of only
  `1.2.0` will now make the plugin compatible to OctoPrint 1.2.0+, not only 1.2.0). Alternatively the compatibility
  information may now contain stuff like `>=1.2,<1.3` in which case the plugin will only be shown as compatible
  to OctoPrint versions 1.2.0 and up but not 1.3.0 or anything above that. See also
  [the requirement specification format of the `pkg_resources` package](https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/pkg_resources.html#requirements-parsing).
* Only print the commands of configured event handlers to the log when a new `debug` flag is present in the config
  (see [the docs](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#events)). Reduces risk of disclosing sensitive data when sharing log files.

### Bug Fixes

* [#956](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/956) - Fixed server crash when trying to configure a default
  slicing profile for a still unconfigured slicer.
* [#957](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/957) - Increased maximum allowed body size for plugin archive uploads.
* Bugs without tickets:
  * Clean exit on `SIGTERM`, calling the shutdown functions provided by plugins.
  * Don't disconnect on `volume.init` errors from the firmware.
  * `touch` uploaded files on local file storage to ensure proper "uploaded date" even for files that are just moved
    from other locations of the file system (e.g. when being added from the `watched` folder).

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1))

## 1.2.0 (2015-06-25)

### Note for Upgraders

  * The [Cura integration](https://github.com/daid/Cura) has changed in such a way that OctoPrint now calls the
    [CuraEngine](https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine) directly instead of depending on the full Cura installation. See
    [the wiki](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Cura) for instructions on how to change your setup to
    accommodate the new integration.

### New Features

* OctoPrint now has a [plugin system](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/index.html) which allows extending its
  core functionality.
  * Plugins may be installed through the new and bundled [Plugin Manager Plugin](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
    available in OctoPrint's settings. This Plugin Manager also allows browsing and easy installation of plugins
    registered on the official [OctoPrint Plugin Repository](http://plugins.octoprint.org).
  * For interested developers there is a [tutorial available in the documentation](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/gettingstarted.html)
    and also a [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/OctoPrint/cookiecutter-octoprint-plugin) to quickly bootstrap
    new plugins.
* Added internationalization of UI. Translations of OctoPrint are being crowd sourced via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/octoprint/).
  Language Packs for both the core application as well as installed plugins can be uploaded through a new management
  dialog in Settings > Appearance > Language Packs. A translation into German is included, further language packs
  will soon be made available.
* Printer Profiles: Printer properties like print volume, extruder offsets etc are now managed via Printer Profiles. A
  connection to a printer will always have a printer profile associated.
* File management now supports STL files as first class citizens (including UI adjustments to allow management of
  uploaded STL files including removal and reslicing) and also allows folders (not yet supported by UI). STL files
  can be downloaded like GCODE files.
* Slicing has been greatly improved:
  * It now allows for a definition of slicing profiles to use for slicing plus overrides which can be defined per slicing
    job (defining overrides is not yet part of the UI but it's on the roadmap).
  * A new slicing dialog has been added which allows (re-)slicing uploaded STL files (which are now displayed in the file list
    as well). The slicing profile and printer profile to use can be specified here as well as the file name to which to
    slice to and the action to take after slicing has been completed (none, selecting the sliced GCODE for printing or
    starting to print it directly)
  * The slicing API allows positioning the model to slice on the print bed (Note: this is not yet available in the UI).
  * Slicers themselves are integrated into the system via ``SlicingPlugins``.
  * Bundled [Cura Plugin](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Cura) allows slicing through CuraEngine up
    to and including 15.04. Existing Cura slicing profiles can be imported through the web interface.
* New file list: Pagination is gone, no more (mobile incompatible) pop overs, instead scrollable and with instant
  search
* You can now define a folder (default: `~/.octoprint/watched`) to be watched for newly added GCODE (or -- if slicing
  support is enabled -- STL) files to automatically add.
* New type of API key: [App Session Keys](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/api/apps.html) for trusted applications
* OctoPrint now supports `action:...` commands received via debug messages (`// action:...`) from the printer. Currently supported are
  - `action:pause`: Pauses the current job in OctoPrint
  - `action:resume`: Resumes the current job in OctoPrint
  - `action:disconnect`: Disconnects OctoPrint from the printer
  Plugins can add supported commands by [hooking](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/hooks.html) into the
  ``octoprint.comm.protocol.action`` hook
* Mousing over the webcam image in the control tab enables key control mode, allowing you to quickly move the axis of your
  printer with your computer's keyboard ([#610](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/610)):
  - arrow keys: X and Y axes
  - W, S / PageUp, PageDown: Z axes
  - Home: Home X and Y axes
  - End: Home Z axes
  - 1, 2, 3, 4: change step size used (0.1, 1, 10, 100mm)
* Controls for adjusting feed and flow rate factor added to Controls ([#362](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/362))
* Custom controls now also support slider controls
* Custom controls now support a row layout
* Users can now define custom GCODE scripts to run upon starting/pausing/resuming/success/failure of a print or for
  custom controls ([#457](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/457), [#347](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/347))
* Bundled [Discovery Plugin](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Discovery) allows discovery of OctoPrint
  instances via SSDP/UPNP and optionally also via ZeroConf/Bonjour/Avahi.
* Bundled [Software Update Plugin](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update) takes care of notifying
  about new OctoPrint releases and also allows updating if configured as such. Plugins may register themselves with the
  update notification and application process through a new hook ["octoprint.plugin.softwareupdate.check_config"](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update#octoprintpluginsoftwareupdatecheck_config).

### Improvements

* Logging is now configurable via config file
* Added last print time to additional GCODE file information
* Better error handling for capture issues during timelapse creation & more robust handling of missing images during
  timelapse creation
* Start counting the layers at 1 instead of 0 in the GCODE viewer
* Upgraded [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to version 3.2.1
* Better error reporting for timelapse rendering and system commands
* Custom control can now be defined so that they show a Confirm dialog with configurable text before executing
  ([#532](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/532) and [#590](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/590))
* Serial communication: Also interpret lines starting with "!!" as errors
* Added deletion of pyc files to the `python setup.py clean` command
* Settings now show a QRCode for the API Key ([#637](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/637))
* Username in UI is no longer enclosed in scare quotes ([#595](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/595))
* Username in login dialog is not automatically capitalized on mobile devices anymore ([#639](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/639))
* "Slicing Done" and "Streaming Done" notifications now have a green background ([#558](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/558))
* Files that are currently in use, be it for slicing, printing or whatever, are now tracked and can not be deleted as
  long as they are in use
* Settings in UI get refreshed when opening settings dialog
* New event "SettingsUpdated"
* "Print time left" is now not displayed until it becomes somewhat stable. Display in web interface now also happens
  in a fuzzy way instead of the format hh:mm:ss, to not suggest a high accuracy anymore where the can't be one. Additionally
  OctoPrint will use data from prior prints to enhance the initial print time estimation.
* Added handler for uncaught exceptions to make sure those get logged, should make the logs even more useful for analysing
  bug reports
* The server now tracks the modification date of the configuration file and reloads it prior to saving the config if
  it has been changed during runtime by external editing, hence no config settings added manually while the server
  was running should be overwritten anymore.
* Display a "Please Reload" overlay when a new server version or a change in installed plugins is detected after a
  reconnect to the server.
* Better handling of errors on the websocket - no more logging of the full stack trace to the log, only a warning
  message for now.
* Daemonized OctoPrint now cleans up its pidfile when receiving a TERM signal ([#711](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/711))
* Added serial types for OpenBSD ([#551](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/551))
* Improved behaviour of terminal:
  * Disabling autoscrolling now also stops cutting off the log while it's enabled, effectively preventing log lines from
    being modified at all ([#735](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/735))
  * Applying filters displays ``[...]`` where lines where removed and doesn't cause scrolling on filtered lines
    anymore ([#286](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/286))
  * Added a link to scroll to the end of the terminal log (useful for when autoscroll is disabled)
  * Added a link to select all current contents of the terminal log for easy copy-pasting
  * Added a display of how many lines are displayed, how many are filtered and how many are available in total
* Frame rate for timelapses can now be configured per timelapse ([#782](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/782))
* Added an option to specify the amount of encoding threads for FFMPEG ([#785](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/785))
* "Disconnected" screen now is not shown directly after a close of the socket, instead the client first tries to
  directly reconnect once, and only if that doesn't work displays the dialog. Should reduce short popups of the dialog
  due to shaky network connections and/or weird browser behaviour when downloading things from the UI.
* Development dependencies can now be installed with ``pip -e .[develop]``
* White and transparent colors ;) are supported for the navigation bar ([#789](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/789))
* Drag-n-drop overlay for file uploads now uses the full available screen space, improving usability on high resolution
  displays ([#187](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/187))
* OctoPrint server should no longer hang when big changes in the system time happen, e.g. after first contact to an
  NTP server on a Raspberry Pi image. Achieved through monkey patching Tornado with
  [this PR](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/pull/1290).
* Serial ports matching ``/dev/ttyAMA*`` are not anymore listed by default (this was the reason for a lot of people
  running into problems while attempting to connect to their printer on their Raspberry Pis, on which ``/dev/ttyAMA0``
  is the OS's serial console by default). Added configuration of additional ports to the Serial Connection section in
  the Settings to make it easier for those people who do indeed have their printer connected to ``/dev/ttyAMA0``.
* Better behaviour of the settings dialog on low-width devices, navigation and content also now scroll independently
  from each other (see also [#823](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/823))
* Renamed "Temperature Timeout" and "SD Status Timeout" in Settings to "Temperature Interval" and "SD Status Interval"
  to better reflect what those values are actually used for.
* Added support for rectangular printer beds with the origin in the center ([#682](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/682)
  and [#852](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/852)). Printer profiles now contain a new settings ``volume.origin``
  which can either be ``lowerleft`` or ``center``. For circular beds only ``center`` is supported.
* Made baudrate detection a bit more solid, still can't perform wonders.
* Only show configuration options for additional extruders if more than one is available, and don't include offset
  configuration for first nozzle which acts as reference for the other offsets ([#677](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/677)).
* Cut off of the temperature graph is now not based on the number of data points any more but on the actual time of the
  data points. Anything older than ``n`` minutes will be cut off, with ``n`` defaulting to 30min. This value can be
  changed under "Temperatures" in the Settings ([#343](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/343)).
* High-DPI support for the GCode viewer ([#837](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/837)).
* Stop websocket connections from multiplying ([#888](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/888)).
* New setting to rotate webcam by 90° counter clockwise ([#895](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/895) and
  [#906](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/906))
* System commands now be set to a) run asynchronized by setting their `async` property to `true` and b) to ignore their
  result by setting their `ignore` property to `true`.
* Various improvements of newly introduced features over the course of development:
  * File management: The new implementation will migrate metadata from the old one upon first startup after upgrade from
    version 1.1.x to 1.2.x. That should speed up initial startup.
  * File management: GCODE Analysis backlog processing has been throttled to not take up too many resources on system
    startup. Freshly uploaded files should still be analyzed at full speed.
  * Plugins: SettingsPlugins may track versions of configuration format stored in `config.yaml`, including a custom
    migration method getting called when a mismatch between the currently stored configuration format version and the one
    reported by the plugin as current is detected.
  * Plugins: Plugins may now have a folder for plugin related data whose path can be retrieved from the plugin itself
    via its new method [`get_plugin_data_folder`](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/modules/plugin.html#octoprint.plugin.types.OctoPrintPlugin.get_plugin_data_folder).
  * Plugin Manager: Don't allow plugin management actions (like installing/uninstalling or enabling/disabling) while the
    printer is printing (see also unreproduced issue [#936](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/936)).
  * Plugin Manager: More options to try to match up installed plugin packages with discovered plugins.
  * Plugin Manager: Display a more friendly message if after the installation of a plugin it could not be correctly
    identifier.
  * Software Update: Enforce refreshing of available updates after any changes in enabled plugins.

    [#634](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/634)). Caused an issue when installing from source archive
    downloaded from Github.
  * [#931](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/931) - Adjusted `octoprint_setuptools` to be compatible to older
    versions of setuptools potentially site-wide installed on hosts.
  * [#942](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/942) - Settings can now be saved again after installing a new
    plugin. Plugins must not use `super` anymore to call parent implementation of `SettingsPlugin.on_settings_save` but
    should instead switch to `SettingsPlugin.on_settings_save(self, ...)`. Settings API will capture related
    `TypeErrors` and log a big warning to the log file indicating which plugin caused the problem and needs to be
    updated. Also updated all bundled plugins accordingly.
  * Software Update: Don't persist more check data than necessary in the configuration. Solves an issue where persisted
    information overrode updated check configuration reported by plugins, leading to a "an update is available" loop.
    An auto-migration function was added that should remove the redundant data.
* Various fixes without tickets:
  * GCODE viewer now doesn't stumble over completely extrusionless GCODE files
  * Do not deliver the API key on settings API unless user has admin rights
  * Don't hiccup on slic3r filament_diameter comments in GCODE generated for multi extruder setups
  * Color code successful or failed print results directly in file list, not just after a reload
  * Changing Timelapse post roll activates save button
  * Timelapse post roll is loaded properly from config
  * Handling of files on the printer's SD card contained in folders now works correctly
  * Don't display a "Disconnected" screen when trying to download a timelapse in Firefox
  * Fixed handling of SD card files in folders
  * Fixed refreshing of timelapse file list upon finished rendering of a new one
  * Fixed ``/api/printer`` which wasn't adapter yet to new internal offset data model
  * Made initial connection to printer a bit more responsive: Having to wait for the first serial timeout before sending
    the first ``M105`` even when not waiting for seeing a "start" caused unnecessary wait times for reaching the
    "Operational" state.
  * Log cancelled prints only once (thanks to @imrahil for the headsup)

* [IRC] Also allow downloading .g files via Tornado

([Commits](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/compare/1.1.0...1.1.1))

## 1.1.0 (2014-09-03)

### New Features

* New REST API, including User API Keys additionally to the global API key. Please note that **this will break existing
  API clients** as it replaces the old API (same endpoint). You can find the documentation of the new API at
  [docs.octoprint.org](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/1.1.0/api/index.html).
* New Event structure allows more flexibility regarding payload data, configuration files will be migrated automatically.
  You can find the documentation of the new event format and its usage at [docs.octoprint.org](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/1.1.0/events/index.html).
* Support for multi extruder setups. With this OctoPrint now in theory supports an unlimited amount of extruders, however
  for now it's artificially limited to 9.
* Log files can be accessed from within the browser via the Settings dialog ([#361](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/361))
* Timelapses can now have a post-roll duration configured which will be rendered into the video too to not let it
  end so abruptly ([#384](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/384))
* The terminal tab now has a command history ([#388](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/388))

### Improvements

* Stopping the application via Ctrl-C produces a less scary message ([#277](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/277))
* Webcam stream is disabled when control tab is not in focus, reduces bandwidth ([#316](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/316))
* M and G commands entered in Terminal tab are automatically converted to uppercase
* GCODE viewer now only loads automatically if GCODE file size is beneath certain threshold (different ones for desktop
  and mobile devices), only actually loads file if user acknowledges that this might be too much for his browser
* Added time needed for printing file to PrintDone event's payload ([#333](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/333))
* Also provide the filename (basename without the path) in print events
* Support for circular beds in the GCODE viewer ([#407](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/407))
* The dimensions of the print bed can now be configured via the Settings ([#396](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/396))
* Target temperature reporting format of Repetier Firmware is now supported as well ([360](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/360))
* Version tracking now based on git tagging and [versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer/). Version number,
  git commit and branch get reported in the format `<version tag>-<commits since then>-g<commit hash> (<branch> branch)`,
  e.g. `1.2.0-dev-172-ga48b5de (devel branch)`.
* Made "Center viewport on model" and "Zoom in on model" in the GCODE viewer automatically deselect and de-apply if
  viewport gets manipulated by the user ([#398](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/398))
* GCODE viewer now interprets inverted axes for printer control and mirrors print bed accordingly ([#431](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/431))
* Added `clean` command to `setup.py`, removes old build artifacts (mostly interesting for developers)
* Added version resource on API which reports application and API version
* Made the navbar static instead of fixed to improve usability on mobile devices ([#257](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/257))
* Switch to password field upon enter in username field, submit login form upon enter in password field
* Changed default path to OctoPrint executable in included init-script to `/usr/local/bin/octoprint` (the default when
  installing via `python setup.py install`)

### Bug Fixes

## 1.0.0 (2014-06-22)

First release with new versioning scheme.
