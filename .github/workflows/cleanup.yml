            Since apparently some of the required information is still missing, this will be
            closed now, sorry. Feel free to request a reopen of this or create a new issue
            once you can provide **all**
            [required information](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-file-a-bug-report).


            This is nothing personal. Thank you for your collaboration.
