READ THE FOLLOWING FIRST:

If not already done, please read the "guidelines for contributing"
that are linked ^-- just up there in the big yellow box. Also read
the FAQ: https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ.

This is a bug and feature tracker, please only use it to report bugs
or request features within OctoPrint (not OctoPi, not any OctoPrint
plugins and not unofficial OctoPrint versions).

Do not seek support here ("I need help with ..."), that belongs on
the mailing list or the G+ community (both linked in the "guidelines
for contributing" linked above, read it!), NOT here.

Mark requests with a "[Request]" prefix in the title please. Fully fill
out the bug reporting template for bug reports (if you don't know where
to find some information - it's all described in the contribution
guidelines linked up there in the big yellow box). Do not delete any
lines from the template but those enclosed in [ and ] - and those please
DO delete, they are only provided for your information and removing them
makes your ticket more readable :)

Thank you!

(Before submitting your ticket, please delete this text up to and
including the line too - it's only here for you, we already know it
by heart ;))

#### What were you doing?

[Please be as specific as possible here. The maintainers will need to
reproduce your issue in order to fix it and that is not possible if they
don't know what you did to get it to happen in the first place.

If you encountered a problem with specific files of any sorts, make sure
to also include a link to a file with which to reproduce the problem.]

a serial.log.]
