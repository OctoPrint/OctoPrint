        ### ✋ **This is bug tracker, not a support forum**


        If something isn't working right, you have questions or need help, [**get in touch on the forums**](https://community.octoprint.org/c/support/).


        Only proceed here if you are 100% sure the issue you are seeing is actually a bug in OctoPrint that *also happens in safe mode*. If in doubt, check
        in on the forums first, we can always file a bug from a support request later.


        ---


        **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in OctoPrint!**


        If this is the first time you are doing this, please take a few moments to read
        through the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
        Also check out [the FAQ](https://faq.octoprint.org) if your
        problem is maybe already covered there.


        You are about to report a bug in **OctoPrint**. Do not proceed if your issues
        occurs with OctoPi, any third party OctoPrint plugins, unofficial or outdated
        OctoPrint versions. If you are unsure of the difference between OctoPrint and
        OctoPi, [read this FAQ entry](https://faq.octoprint.org/octoprint-vs-octopi).




        And finally, make sure any bug you want to report is still present with the **current**
        OctoPrint version and that it does not vanish when you start OctoPrint
        in [safe mode](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/safemode.html) either.


        Thank you for your collaboration!

      description: >-
        Testing in safe mode is required to make sure the issue you are reporting is not
        caused by a third party plugin. Please see [here](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/safemode.html)
        on how to run OctoPrint in safe mode.
      options:
        - Yes, it did persist
        - No, it did not persist (it's an issue with one of your installed plugins, don't report here)
        - I cannot test this issue in safe mode (state why below)

      label: If you could not test in safe mode, please state why
      description: >-
        Issues caused by a third party plugin are a major cause of bugs reported here, so we really need to
        rule out that a plugin is at fault here. [Safe mode](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/safemode.html) is an easy way to do that. Only skip safe mode
        if your particular problem *absolutely requires* third party plugins to be enabled. "It would take
        too long" is **not** a reason to skip testing in safe mode, neither is "I do not know how to
        enable it" as you can find info on that [here](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/safemode.html).

        If you really *cannot* test in safe mode, leave a short explanation as to why.

        Please also be sure to upload the following files below:

          * Systeminfo Bundle: See [here](https://community.octoprint.org/t/what-is-a-systeminfo-bundle-and-how-can-i-obtain-one/29887) if you don't know where to find that. Just attach down below as-is. Note that you'll need at least OctoPrint 1.6.0 for this to be available - we no longer accept bug reports created for older versions than this.
            * If you are reporting an issue that involves communicating with you printer, **be sure to enable `serial.log` before reproducing and creating the Systeminfo Bundle**!
          * Your browser's JavaScript console, if you are reporting a problem with the
            user interface. See [here](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers) on where to find that.
          * If possible, screenshots or videos showing the problem, especially if you
            are reporting a problem with the user interface!
          * GCODE files with which to reproduce, if you are reporting an issue with
            GCODE file analysis or printing behaviour.

        Please be aware that unless at least Systeminfo Bundle is included, your bug report
        will not be processed and closed after a while.
