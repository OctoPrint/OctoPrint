Thank you for your interest into contributing to OctoPrint, it's
highly appreciated!

Please make sure you have read the "guidelines for contributing" as
linked just above this form, there's a section on Pull Requests in there
as well that contains important information.

As a summary, please make sure you have ticked all points on this
checklist:

  * [ ] Your changes are not possible to do through a plugin and relevant
    to a large audience (ideally all users of OctoPrint)
  * [ ] If your changes are large or otherwise disruptive: You have
    made sure your changes don't interfere with current development by
    talking it through with the maintainers, e.g. through a
    Brainstorming ticket
  * [ ] Your PR targets OctoPrint's devel branch, or maintenance if it's
    a bug fix for an issue present in the current stable version (no PRs
    against master or anything else)
  * [ ] Your PR was opened from a custom branch on your repository
    (no PRs from your version of master, maintenance or devel please),
    e.g. dev/my_new_feature
  * [ ] Your PR only contains relevant changes: no unrelated files,
    no dead code, ideally only one commit - rebase your PR if necessary!
  * [ ] Your changes follow the existing coding style
  * [ ] If your changes include style sheets: You have modified the
    .less source files, not the .css files (those are generated with
    lessc)
  * [ ] You have tested your changes (please state how!) - ideally you
    have added unit tests
  * [ ] You have run the existing unit tests against your changes and
    nothing broke
  * [ ] You have added yourself to the AUTHORS.md file :)
