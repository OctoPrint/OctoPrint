This shiny new release contains two new pieces
of functionality on top of the usual fixes of bugs and little annoyances,
the "About" dialog and the Announcement Plugin.

<!-- more -->

The new **"About" dialog** within OctoPrint not only
contains information about the project (such as homepage, license etc)
but also lists all authors and [the supporters](/support-octoprint/).
It's also extendable by plugins and I hope I'll find the time to 
document that soon.

The first time I had the idea
of introducing something like the **Announcement Plugin** into OctoPrint was back in 
1.2.7 when I had to somehow notify all of you about the solution to the 
bug within the update mechanism. It was tricky to 
notify the whole OctoPrint user base of the necessary steps since not
everyone follows OctoPrint on the various social media outlets or
reads the release notes. Hence a way to push important information such as
such update heads-ups, security announcements or critical project
news (such as the recent [funding crisis](/blog/2016/04/13/i-need-your-support/))
right to your OctoPrint instances now exists with the announcement
plugin. It is basically an RSS reader which currently allows you to
subscribe to the "important announcement" category on the [OctoBlog](/blog/)
itself plus some other optional categories as well as the feed
of the [plugin repository](http://plugins.octoprint.org). I also hope 
to open it up to allow you to add your favourite 3d printing related feeds 
soon and allow plugins to register additional channels as well. For now it
at least will make sure that if there is a critical announcement, there is 
way for your OctoPrint instance to show it to you.

Besides those two new things, as already mentioned there was also a couple
of kinks ironed out. I (and you ;)) have to thank [Mark Walker](https://github.com/markwal), 
[Marc Hannappel](https://github.com/Salandora) and [Paul de Vries](https://github.com/BillyBlaze)
for these because sadly I had and still have my hands full with the whole 
funding crisis - so a **big thank you** for taking care!

And while we are at saying thank you, also a **big thank you to every
single supporter** who's become a Patron or contributed something via Paypal over the past
couple of weeks since the initial announcement. I've been overwhelmed
by the community's response to my call for help, and it's made me even 
more eager to make all this continue to work in the future - something 
I've been working on with all that I have. Thank you! :)

With that being said, finally the usual gist!

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual 
[on github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.11).

It may take up to 24h for your update notification to pop up, so don't 
be alarmed if it doesn't show up immediately after reading this.

If you don't get an "Update Now" button with your update notification, 
read [this](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update#making-octoprint-updateable-on-existing-installations)
or - even more specifically - [this](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update#octoprint--125)

If you do get an "Update Now" button but the update is immediately 
reported to be successful without any changes, read [this](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ#im-running-127-i-tried-to-update-to-a-newer-version-via-the-software-update-plugin-but-im-still-on-127-after-restart).
