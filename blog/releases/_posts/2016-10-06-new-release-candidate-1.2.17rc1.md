excerpt: The first release candidate of the 1.2.17 release, with
  various improvements and bug fixes.

---

The 1.2.17 release is going to be a true maintenance release again, consisting
of only small improvements and bug fixes, most of which are of a more 
specialized nature. It however also fixes a logout issue caused by
the "remember me" cookie not being properly deleted any more, so if you
are experiencing that, this release candidate should make you very happy ;)

**If you are tracking the "Maintenance RC" release channel**, you
should soon get an update notification just like you are used to from
stable releases.

**If you are not interested in helping to test release candidates**, just
ignore this post, 1.2.17 stable will hit your instance via the usual
way once it's ready :)

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual 
[on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.17rc1).

Depending on how the feedback for this release candidate turns out, I'll
either look into releasing 1.2.17 or fix any observed regressions and push 
out a second release candidate within the next week.
