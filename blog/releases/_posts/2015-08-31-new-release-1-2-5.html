Mostly fixes of minor bugs and annoyances but also a couple of improvements:<br />
<!-- more -->
<br />
  * The settings dialog now visualizes when settings are saving and when they are being retrieved<br />
  * Better compatibility with the Repetier firmware<br />
  * Easier configuration of the OctoPrint update mechanism in the Software Update Plugin (including hints in the UI on what to do)<br />
  * Made disk space running low a bit more obvious through visual warning on configurable thresholds<br />
