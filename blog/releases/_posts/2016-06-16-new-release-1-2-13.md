What's this, another release just one week after the last one? Yep, and
it's just to make your OctoPrint experience as smooth as possible :)

<!-- more -->

I sadly had to discover yesterday that the last minute fix I made for the
1.2.12 release last week had unintended side effects, leading to the
plugin manager and software update dialogs to not be properly populated
(and in case of the plugin manager to hint at a problem in discovering
`pip` that wasn't actually there). This issue could be solved by simply
logging out and back in again, but that's not something I'd like to see
in a stable release longer than absolutely necessary.

So here's a new release that fixes that! And on top of that you also get
the following bug fixes as well:

  * The `B:` output contained in position responses in current Marlin builds
    with enabled `COREXY` configuration is no longer interpreted as a bed
    temperature.
  * The temperature graph now properly initializes even before a connection
    to the printer is established (it looked a bit empty before).
  * Frontend startup no longer runs into trouble if the browser doesn't support
    browser visibility tracking or any of the capabilities required by
    the GCODE viewer.

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual 
[on github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.13).

It may take up to 24h for your update notification to pop up, so don't 
be alarmed if it doesn't show up immediately after reading this.

If you don't get an "Update Now" button with your update notification, 
read [this](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update#making-octoprint-updateable-on-existing-installations)
or - even more specifically - [this](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update#octoprint--125).

If you do get an "Update Now" button but the update is immediately 
reported to be successful without any changes, read [this](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ#im-running-127-i-tried-to-update-to-a-newer-version-via-the-software-update-plugin-but-im-still-on-127-after-restart).
