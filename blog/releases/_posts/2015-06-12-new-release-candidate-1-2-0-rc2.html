Since there were some minor issues reported with the RC1 (concerning backwards compatibility to older versions of setuptools and pip that are still present on a large number of systems out there) I fixed those and just tagged RC2.<br />

<b>Please test this and report back</b>. I want to release the final 1.2.0 version next week, and I&#39;d prefer if I didn&#39;t have to do a bugfix release immediately after, so any reports I get now help to get 1.2.0 as stable as possible for general consumption.﻿
