This should have been released way faster after 1.2.9, since it fixes two bugs introduced by this release, but a nasty flu that&#39;s making the rounds in Germany got in the way of this. While this time we have mostly fixes of bugs and little annoyances, at least a hand full of minor improvements also made it into this release:<br />
<!-- more -->
<br />
  * The performance of the console output during plugin installation and deinstallation was improved.<br />
  * Some performance improvements in the communication layer were done.<br />
  * The &quot;firmware error&quot; message introduced in the last release was reworded to make it more obvious that a general communication error occured.<br />
  * OctoPrint now allows management of .mp4 timelapse files, which is of interest to people who&#39;ve taken to using a wrapper script to generate those instead of .mpg files. See the release notes for details on this.<br />
  * A bunch of less commonly used configuration options in the Serial settings got their own &quot;Advanced options&quot; section.<br />
<br />
Since most changes this time happened under the hood, no screen shots, sorry ;)<br />
