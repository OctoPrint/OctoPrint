A lot of people have complained about OctoPrint&#39;s default web interface not being optimized for mobile or small screen devices, and rightly so. One of the reasons why I created the plugin interface for OctoPrint 1.2.0 was that I hoped that it would enable people to get creative and solve such pain points themselves, and it&#39;s great to see developers like Paul de Vries aka &quot;Billy Blaze&quot; stepping up to that challenge.<br />

His TouchUI Plugin basically reskins the existing web interface to optimize it for the use with small screen and touch enabled devices such as your mobile, your tablet or an embedded display on your Pi while keeping the core interface on desktop browsers. The current edition of the 3D Printing Thursday series of videos by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112526208786662512291" oid="112526208786662512291">Adafruit Industries</a></span> takes a closer look at what the plugin brings to the table, so don&#39;t miss it!<br />
<br />
If you want to give it a drive yourself, you can find it in OctoPrint plugin repository, either via the Plugin Manager on your OctoPrint installation or from the plugin repository at <a href="http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/touchui/">http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/touchui/</a>. It&#39;s official home page can be found at <a href="http://billyblaze.github.io/OctoPrint-TouchUI/">http://billyblaze.github.io/OctoPrint-TouchUI/</a>.<br />

Keep the awesome plugins coming! :)﻿
