I don't know about you, but with 
[all](/blog/2016/04/13/i-need-your-support/) [that](/blog/2016/05/25/state-of-octoprint)
[happened](/blog/2016/12/08/new-release-1.3.0/) this year I'm certainly 
looking forward to spending some quality time with my loved ones, 
the smell of the christmas tree, twinkling lights, hot tea, a good book 
and all those other nice things that've made up this time of the year for
me since early childhood! Which means
that until January I'll be largely offline from the world of OctoPrint
and do just that, so that I'll be hopefully back in full force
in 2017 in order to start working on the next releases :)

As a small gift I dug up the very first posts about OctoPrint from my G+ 
archive - OctoPrint is already turning four on the 25th, can you believe it? :)

The rest is history as they say ;)

With that being said, let me now finally wish you all Happy Holidays, 
a Happy New Year and of course also Happy Printing and I hope we'll see 
each other again in 2017!

Cheers!
