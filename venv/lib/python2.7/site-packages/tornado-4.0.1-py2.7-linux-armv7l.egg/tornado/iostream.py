        To detect closed connections, we must have called

        much as possible so we don't have to set an `IOLoop.ERROR`
        listener that will be overwritten by the next slow-path
        operation.  As long as there are callbacks scheduled for
        fast-path ops, those callbacks may do more reads.

    This class supports the read and write methods from `BaseIOStream`
    plus a `connect` method.

    The ``socket`` parameter may either be connected or unconnected.

    `socket.accept <socket.socket.accept>`.  For client operations the
    socket is created with `socket.socket`, and may either be
    connected before passing it to the `IOStream` or connected with
    `IOStream.connect`.
