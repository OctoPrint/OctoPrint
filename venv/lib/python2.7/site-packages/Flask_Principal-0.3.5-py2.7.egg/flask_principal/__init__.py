from flask.signals import Namespace

signals = Namespace()


identity_changed = signals.signal('identity-changed', doc="""
Signal sent when the identity for a request has been changed.

Actual name: ``identity-changed``

Authentication providers should send this signal when authentication has been
successfully performed. Flask-Principal connects to this signal and
causes the identity to be saved in the session.

For example::

    from flaskext.principal import Identity, identity_changed

    def login_view(req):
        username = req.form.get('username')
        # check the credentials
        identity_changed.send(app, identity=Identity(username))
""")


identity_loaded = signals.signal('identity-loaded', doc="""
Signal sent when the identity has been initialised for a request.

Actual name: ``identity-loaded``

Identity information providers should connect to this signal to perform two
major activities:

    1. Populate the identity object with the necessary authorization provisions.
    2. Load any additional user information.

For example::

    from flaskext.principal import identity_loaded, RoleNeed, UserNeed

    @identity_loaded.connect
    def on_identity_loaded(sender, identity):
        # Get the user information from the db
        user = db.get(identity.name)
        # Update the roles that a user can provide
        for role in user.roles:
            identity.provides.add(RoleNeed(role.name))
        # Save the user somewhere so we only look it up once
        identity.user = user
""")


Need = namedtuple('Need', ['method', 'value'])
"""A required need

This is just a named tuple, and practically any tuple will do.

The ``method`` attribute can be used to look up element 0, and the ``value``
attribute can be used to look up element 1.
"""

TypeNeed = partial(Need, 'type')
TypeNeed.__doc__ = """A need with the method preset to `"type"`."""


ActionNeed = partial(Need, 'action')
TypeNeed.__doc__ = """A need with the method preset to `"action"`."""


ItemNeed = namedtuple('ItemNeed', ['method', 'value', 'type'])
"""A required item need

addition to other Needs, there is a type, for example this could be specified
as::

And that might describe the permission to update a particular blog post. In
