Description: ``pkginfo`` README
        ==================
        
        This package provides an API for querying the distutils metadata written in
        the ``PKG-INFO`` file inside a source distriubtion (an ``sdist``) or a
        binary distribution (e.g., created by running ``bdist_egg``).  It can
        also query the ``EGG-INFO`` directory of an installed distribution, and
        the ``*.egg-info`` stored in a "development checkout"
        (e.g, created by running ``setup.py develop``).
        
        
        Please see the `pkginfo docs <http://packages.python.org/pkginfo>`_
        for detailed documentation.

        ------------------
        
        - Fix test failure under Python >= 2.7, which is enforcing
          'metadata_version == 1.1' because we have classifiers.
        
        
        0.9 (2012-04-25)
        ----------------

          They may be installed as eggs or via dist-installed 'egg-info' files.
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/pkginfo/+bug/934311
        
        - Avoid a regression in 0.8 under Python 2.6 / 2.7 when parsing unicode.
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/pkginfo/+bug/733827/comments/3
        
        
        0.8 (2011-03-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Work around Python 2.7's breakage of StringIO.  Fixes
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/pkginfo/+bug/733827
        
        - Fix bug in introspection of installed packages missing the
          ``__package__`` attribute.
          
        
        0.7 (2010-11-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Preserve newlines in the ``description`` field.  Thanks to Sridhar
          Ratnakumar for the patch.
        
        - 100% test coverage.
        
        
        0.6 (2010-06-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Replace use of ``StringIO.StringIO`` with ``io.StringIO``, where available
          (Python >= 2.6).
        
        - Replace use of ``rfc822`` stdlib module with ``email.parser``, when
          available (Python >= 2.5).  Ensured that distributions "unfold" wrapped
          continuation lines, stripping any leading / trailing whitespace, no matter
          which module was used for parsing.
        
        - Remove bogus testing dependency on ``zope.testing``.
        
        - Add tests that the "environment markers" spelled out in the approved
          PEP 345 are captured.
        
        - Add ``Project-URL`` for ``1.2`` PKG-INFO metdata (defined in the accepted
          version of PEP 345).
        
        
        0.5 (2009-09-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Marked package as non-zip-safe.
        
        - Fix Trove metadata misspelling.
        
        - Restore compatibility with Python 2.4.
        
        - Note that the introspection of installed packages / modules works only
          in Python 2.6 or later.
        
        - Add ``Index`` class as an abstraction over a collection of distributions.
        
        - Add ``download_url_prefix`` argument to ``pkginfo`` script.  If passed,
          the script will use the prefix to synthesize a ``download_url`` for
          distributions which do not supply that value directly.
        
        
        0.4.1 (2009-05-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix bugs in handling of installed packages which lack ``__file__``
          or ``PKG-INFO``.
        
        
        0.4 (2009-05-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Extend the console script to allow output as CSV or INI.  Also, added
          arguments to specify the metadata version and other parsing / output
          policies.
        
        - Add support for the different metadata versions specified in PEPs
          241, 314, and 345.  Distributions now parse and expose only the attributes
          corresponding to their metadata version, which defaults to the version
          parsed from the ``PKG-INFO`` file.  The programmer can override that version
          when creating the distribution object.
        
        
        0.3 (2009-05-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Add support for introspection of "development eggs" (checkouts with
          ``PKG-INFO``, perhaps created via ``setup.py develop``).
        
        - Add a console script, ``pkginfo``, which takes one or more paths
          on the command line and writes out the associated information.  Thanks
          to ``runeh`` for the patch!
        
        - Add ``get_metadata`` helper function, which dispatches a given path or
          module across the available distribution types, and returns a distribution
          object.  Thanks to ``runeh`` for the patch!
        
        - Make distribution objects support iteration over the metadata fields.
          Thanks to ``runeh`` for the patch!
        
        - Make ``Distribution`` and subclasses new-style classes.  Thanks to ``runeh``
          for the patch!
        
        
        0.2 (2009-04-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Add support for introspection of ``bdist_egg`` binary distributions.
        
        
        0.1.1 (2009-04-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix packaging errors.
        
        
        0.1 (2009-04-10)
        ----------------
