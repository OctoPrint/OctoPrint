Description: 
        Werkzeug
        ========
        
        Werkzeug started as simple collection of various utilities for WSGI
        applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility
        modules.  It includes a powerful debugger, full featured request and
        response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control
        headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL
        routing system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules.
        
        Werkzeug is unicode aware and doesn't enforce a specific template
        engine, database adapter or anything else.  It doesn't even enforce
        a specific way of handling requests and leaves all that up to the
        developer. It's most useful for end user applications which should work
        on as many server environments as possible (such as blogs, wikis,
        bulletin boards, etc.).
        
        Details and example applications are available on the
        `Werkzeug website <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/>`_.
