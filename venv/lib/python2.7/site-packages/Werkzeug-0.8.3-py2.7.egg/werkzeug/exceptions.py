    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This module implements a number of Python exceptions you can raise from
    within your views to trigger a standard non-200 response.


    Usage Example
    -------------

    ::

        from werkzeug.wrappers import BaseRequest
        from werkzeug.wsgi import responder
        from werkzeug.exceptions import HTTPException, NotFound

        def view(request):
            raise NotFound()

        @responder
        def application(environ, start_response):
            request = BaseRequest(environ)
            try:
                return view(request)
            except HTTPException, e:
                return e


    As you can see from this example those exceptions are callable WSGI
    applications.  Because of Python 2.4 compatibility those do not extend
    from the response objects but only from the python exception class.

    As a matter of fact they are not Werkzeug response objects.  However you
    can get a response object by calling ``get_response()`` on a HTTP
    exception.

    Keep in mind that you have to pass an environment to ``get_response()``
    because some errors fetch additional information from the WSGI
    environment.

    If you want to hook in a different exception page to say, a 404 status
    code, you can add a second except for a specific subclass of an error::

        @responder
        def application(environ, start_response):
            request = BaseRequest(environ)
            try:
                return view(request)
            except NotFound, e:
                return not_found(request)
            except HTTPException, e:
                return e
