Requirements for printing schedule:

	-Add a button in the row with the options available for the user (view more information, load, load and print...) in case is a gcode file
	
	-Enable button usage if user is logged in and disable if not

	-If button is pressed, show a settings window with the following options:
		
		-Date and time to start printing

		-Security margin (from my experience, printings take approximately 10 more minutes than expected time) to allow changing mirrors where 			object is placed

		-Save and cancel buttons

	-When pressing save:
	
		-Check printer status to know if user settings are valid (e.g. if it is possible to start the scheduled job when set)

		-Make sure date and time are later than current

		-If any of them are not valid, notify user that something went wrong

	-Create a crontab entry as octoprint service may not be running to make sure the job is done

	-Add a link to see scheduled jobs
