Requirements for warning if object exceedes printing area
	-Check if file is gcode (stl as well?)
	-Consult G0 and G1 commands
	-Consult dimensions in settings (possible to do also in firmware?) 
	-Compare command values with dimensions

Solution:
	-Changed analysis.py under /src/octoprint
		-Added warning to result, which can be true or false depending on the analysis.

	-Changed files.js under /src/octoprint/static/js/app/viewmodels

		-Checked data["gcodeAnalysis"]["warning"]. In case it is true, creates a new Pnotify object to warn the user that an object inside the file exceeds the printing area.

		-Checked data["name"] to get the name of the file
