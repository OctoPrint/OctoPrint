      * Access the **embedded webcam feed** and watch remotely how your printer is creating your newest thing.

      * Get constant feedback regarding the **current progress of your print job**.

      * Take a look at the **integrated GCODE visualizer** to see a rendition of the GCODE you are currently printing.

      * Keep an eye on the **temperatures** of your hotends and print bed and adapt them on the fly.

      * Move the print head **along all axes**, extrude, retract or just define your own [custom controls]().

      * **Start, stop or just pause your current print job**, you are in full control at any time.'

  short-description: OctoPrint's powerful plugin system allows extending its functionality and the integrated plugin repository makes it easy to find and install awesome plugins from the community.
  description: 'Out of the box OctoPrint is **compatible with most of the available consumer 3D printers**. And its
      powerful plugin system allows extending its functionality in various ways. To name a few:


      * Have OctoPrint send you **push notifications** on job progress via [Pushbullet](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/octobullet/), [Pushover](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/pushover/) or [Mail](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/emailnotifier/).

      * Completely **replace OctoPrint''s UI** on mobile devices via [TouchUI](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/touchui/).

      * Integrate OctoPrint into your **messaging tool** of choice, like [Telegram](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/telegram/) or [Slack](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/slack/).

      * Collect **statistics** of your printer and print jobs via the [Print History](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/printhistory/) or the [Printer Statistics](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/stats/) plugin.

      * Add **support for specific printers** like [Flashforge printers or older Makerbots](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/gpx/) or the [Micro 3D printer](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/m3dfio/).


    OctoPrint''s [official plugin repository](http://plugins.octoprint.org/) is integrated right within OctoPrint and installing a plugin is only
    a click away. And [getting started](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/index.html) on plugin development is easy!'
