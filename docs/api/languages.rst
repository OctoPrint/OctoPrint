.. _sec-api-languages-upload:

Upload a language pack
======================

.. http:post:: /api/languages

   Uploads a new language pack to OctoPrint.

   Other than most of the other requests on OctoPrint's API which are expected as JSON, this request is expected as
   ``Content-Type: multipart/form-data`` due to the included file upload.

   To upload a file, the request body must contain the ``file`` form field with the
   contents and file name of the file to upload.

   Only files with one of the extensions ``zip``, ``tar.gz``, ``tgz`` or ``tar`` will be
   processed, for other file extensions a :http:statuscode:`400` will be returned.

   Will return a list of installed language packs upon completion, as described in
   :ref:`Retrieve installed language packs <sec-api-languages-list>`.

   :form file:      The language pack file to upload
   :statuscode 200: The file was uploaded successfully

.. _sec-api-languages-delete:

Delete a language pack
======================

.. http:delete:: /api/languages/(string:locale)/(string:pack)

   Deletes the language pack ``pack`` for locale ``locale``. Can be either
   the ``_core`` pack (containing translations for core OctoPrint) or
   the language pack for a plugin specified by the plugin identifier.

   Returns a list of installed language packs, as described in
   :ref:`Retrieve installed language packs <sec-api-languages-list>`.

   **Example**

   .. sourcecode:: http

      DELETE /api/languages/it/some_plugin HTTP/1.1

      X-Api-Key: abcdef...
