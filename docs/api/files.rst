Retrieve all files
==================

.. http:get:: /api/files

   Retrieve information regarding all files currently available and regarding the disk space still available
   locally in the system.

   By default only returns the files and folders in the root directory. If the query parameter ``recursive``
   is provided and set to ``true``, returns all files and folders.

   Returns a :ref:`Retrieve response <sec-api-fileops-datamodel-retrieveresponse>`.

   **Example 1**:

   Fetch only the files and folders from the root folder.

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/files HTTP/1.1

.. _sec-api-fileops-uploadfile:

Upload file or create folder
============================

.. http:post:: /api/files/(string:location)

   Upload a file to the selected ``location`` or create a new empty folder on it.

   Other than most of the other requests on OctoPrint's API which are expected as JSON, this request is expected as
   ``Content-Type: multipart/form-data`` due to the included file upload.

   To upload a file, the request body must at least contain the ``file`` form field with the
   contents and file name of the file to upload.

   To create a new folder, the request body must at least contain the ``foldername`` form field,
   specifying the name of the new folder. Note that folder creation is currently only supported on
   the ``local`` file system.

   Returns a :http:statuscode:`201` response with a ``Location`` header set to the management URL of the uploaded
   file and an :ref:`Upload Response <sec-api-fileops-datamodel-uploadresponse>` as the body upon successful completion.

   Requires user rights.

   :form print:      Whether to start printing the file directly after upload (``true``) or not (``false``). If set, ``select``
                     is implicitely ``true`` as well. Optional, defaults to ``false``. Ignored when creating a folder.
   :form userdata:   [Optional] An optional string that if specified will be interpreted as JSON and then saved along
                     with the file as metadata (metadata key ``userdata``). Ignored when creating a folder.
   :form foldername: The name of the folder to create. Ignored when uploading a file.

                     is disabled
   :statuscode 409:  If the upload of the file would override the file that is currently being printed or if an upload
                     to SD card was requested and the printer is either not operational or currently busy with a print job.
   :statuscode 415:  If the file is neither a ``gcode`` nor an ``stl`` file (or it is an ``stl`` file but slicing support
                     is disabled)
   :statuscode 500:  If the upload failed internally

.. _sec-api-fileops-retrievefileinfo:

Retrieve a specific file's or folder's information
==================================================

.. http:get:: /api/files/(string:location)/(path:filename)

   Retrieves the selected file's or folder's information.

   If the file is unknown, a :http:statuscode:`404` is returned.

   If the targeted path is a folder, by default only its direct children will be returned. If ``recursive`` is
   provided and set to ``true``, all sub folders and their children will be returned too.

   On success, a :http:statuscode:`200` is returned, with a :ref:`file information item <sec-api-datamodel-files-file>`
   as the response body.

.. _sec-api-fileops-filecommand:

Issue a file command
====================

.. http:post:: /api/files/(string:location)/(path:path)

   Issue a file command to an existing file. Currently supported commands are:

   select
     Selects a file for printing. Additional parameters are:

     * ``print``: Optional, if set to ``true`` the file will start printing directly after selection. If the printer
       is not operational when this parameter is present and set to ``true``, the request will fail with a response
       of ``409 Conflict``.

     Upon success, a status code of :http:statuscode:`204` and an empty body is returned.

   slice
     Slices an STL file into GCODE. Note that this is an asynchronous operation that will take place in the background
     after the response has been sent back to the client. Additional parameters are:

     * ``slicer``: The slicing engine to use, defaults to ``cura`` if not set, which is also the only supported slicer right now.
     * ``gcode``: Name of the GCODE file to generated, in the same location as the STL file. Defaults to the STL file name
       with extension ``.gco`` if not set.
     * ``position``: Position of the object-to-slice's center on the print bed. A dictionary containing both ``x`` and ``y``
       coordinate in mm is expected
     * ``printerProfile``: Name of the printer profile to use, if not set the default printer profile will be used.
     * ``profile``: Name of the slicing profile to use, if not set the default slicing profile of the slicer will be used.
     * ``profile.*``: Override parameters, the ``profile.`` prefix will be stripped and the matching profile key will
       be overridden with the supplied value. Use this if you want to specify things that change often like a different
       temperature, filament diameter or infill percentage. Profile keys are slicer specific.
     * ``select``: Optional, if set to ``true`` the file be selected for printing right after the slicing has finished. If the
       printer is not operational or already printing when this parameter is present and set to ``true``, the request will
       fail with a response of ``409 Conflict``
     * ``print``: Optional, if set to ``true`` the file be selected and start printing right after the slicing has finished.
       If the printer is not operational or already printing when this parameter is present and set to ``true``, the request
       will fail with a response of ``409 Conflict``. Note that if this parameter is set, the parameter ``select`` does not
       need to be set, it is automatically assumed to be ``true`` too, otherwise no printing would be possible.

     If consecutive slicing calls are made targeting the same GCODE filename (that also holds true if the default is used),
     the slicing job already running in the background will be cancelled before the new one is started. Note that this will
     also mean that if it was supposed to be directly selected and start printing after the slicing finished, this will not
     take place anymore and whether this will happen with the new sliced file depends entirely on the new request!

     Upon success, a status code of :http:statuscode:`202` and a :ref:`sec-api-datamodel-files-fileabridged` in the response
     body will be returned.

   copy
     Copies the file or folder to a new ``destination`` on the same ``location``. Additional parameters are:

     * ``destination``: The path of the parent folder to which to copy the file or folder. It must already exist.

     If there already exists a file or folder of the same name at ``destination``, the request will return a :http:statuscode:`409`.
     If the ``destination`` folder does not exist, a :http:statuscode:`404` will be returned.

     Upon success, a status code of :http:statuscode:`201` and a :ref:`sec-api-datamodel-files-fileabridged` in the response
     body will be returned.

   move
     Moves the file or folder to a new ``destination`` on the same ``location``. Additional parameters are:

     * ``destination``: The path of the parent folder to which to move the file or folder.

     If there already exists a file or folder of the same name at ``destination``, the request will return a :http:statuscode:`409`.
     If the ``destination`` folder does not exist, a :http:statuscode:`404` will be returned. If the ``path`` is currently
     in use by OctoPrint (e.g. it is a GCODE file that's currently being printed) a :http:statuscode:`409` will be
     returned.

     Upon success, a status code of :http:statuscode:`201` and a :ref:`sec-api-datamodel-files-fileabridged` in the response
     body will be returned.

   Requires user rights.
