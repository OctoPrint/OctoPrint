Printer operations

.. warning::

   This part of the API is still heavily in development, especially anything that has to do with temperature control.
   If you happen to want to develop against it, you should drop me an email to make sure I can give you a heads-up when
   something changes.

.. contents::

Printer control is mostly achieved through the use of commands, issued to resources reflecting components of the
printer. OctoPrint currently knows the following components:

Print head
  Print head commands allow jogging and homing the print head in all three axes. Querying the resource is currently
  not supported.
  See :ref:`sec-api-printer-printheadcommand`.
Tool
  Tool commands allow setting the temperature and temperature offsets for the printer's hotends/tools. Querying the
  corresponding resource returns temperature information including an optional history.
  See :ref:`sec-api-printer-toolcommand`.
Bed
  Bed commands allow setting the temperature and temperature offset for the printer's heated bed. Querying the
  corresponding resource returns temperature information including an optional history.
  See :ref:`sec-api-printer-bedcommand`.
SD card
  SD commands allow initialization, refresh and release of the printer's SD card (if available). Querying the
  corresponding resource returns the current SD card state.
  See :ref:`sec-api-printer-sdcommand`.

Besides that, OctoPrint also provides a :ref:`full state report of the printer <sec-api-printer-state>`.

.. _sec-api-printer-state:

Retrieve the current printer state
==================================

.. http:get:: /api/printer

   Retrieves the current state of the printer. Returned information includes:

   * temperature information (see also :ref:`Retrieve the current tool state <sec-api-printer-toolstate>` and
     :ref:`Retrieve the current bed state <sec-api-printer-bedstate>`)
   * sd state (if available, see also :ref:`Retrieve the current SD state <sec-api-printer-sdstate>`)
   * general printer state

   Temperature information can also be made to include the printer's temperature history by supplying the ``history``
   query parameter. The amount of data points to return here can be limited using the ``limit`` query parameter.

   Clients can specific a list of attributes to not return in the response (e.g. if they don't need it) via the
   ``exclude`` query parameter.

   Returns a :http:statuscode:`200` with a :ref:`Full State Response <sec-api-printer-datamodel-fullstate>` in the
   body upon success.

       starting with 0.

   select
     Selects the printer's current tool. Additional parameters:

     * ``tool``: Tool to select, format ``tool{n}`` with ``n`` being the tool's index starting with 0.

.. _sec-api-printer-sdcommand:

Issue an SD command
===================

.. http:post:: /api/printer/sd

   SD commands allow initialization, refresh and release of the printer's SD card (if available).

   Available commands are:

   init
     Initializes the printer's SD card, making it available for use. This also includes an initial retrieval of the
     list of files currently stored on the SD card, so after issueing that command a :ref:`retrieval of the files
     on SD card <sec-api-fileops-retrievelocation>` will return a successful result.

     .. note::
        If OctoPrint detects the availability of a SD card on the printer during connection, it will automatically attempt
        to initialize it.

   refresh
     Refreshes the list of files stored on the printer's SD card. Will return a :http:statuscode:`409` if the card
     has not been initialized yet (see the ``init`` command and :ref:`SD state <sec-api-printer-sdstate>`).

   release
     Releases the SD card from the printer. The reverse operation to ``init``. After issuing this command, the SD
     card won't be available anymore, hence and operations targeting files stored on it will fail. Will return a :http:statuscode:`409`
     if the card has not been initialized yet (see the ``init`` command and :ref:`SD state <sec-api-printer-sdstate>`).

   Upon success, a status code of :http:statuscode:`204` and an empty body is returned.

   **Example Init Request**

   Initialize the SD card.

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/printer/sd HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
        "command": "init"
      }

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

   **Example Refresh Request**

   Refresh the file list of the SD card

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/printer/sd HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/json
      X-Api-Key: abcdef...

      {
        "command": "refresh"
      }

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

   **Example Release Request**

   Release the SD card

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/printer/sd HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/json
      X-Api-Key: abcdef...

      {
        "command": "release"
      }

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

   :json string command: The command to issue, either ``init``, ``refresh`` or ``release``.
   :statuscode 204:      No error
   :statuscode 409:      If a ``refresh`` or ``release`` command is issued but the SD card has not been initialized (e.g.
                         via ``init``.

.. _sec-api-printer-sdstate:

Retrieve the current SD state
=============================

.. http:get:: /api/printer/sd

   Retrieves the current state of the printer's SD card. For this request no authentication is needed.

   If SD support has been disabled in OctoPrint's settings, a :http:statuscode:`404` is returned.

   Returns a :http:statuscode:`200` with an :ref:`SD State Response <sec-api-printer-datamodel-sdstate>` in the body
   upon success.

   **Example**

   Read the current state of the SD card.

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/printer/sd HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      X-Api-Key: abcdef...

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
        "ready": true
      }

   :statuscode 200: No error
   :statuscode 404: If SD support has been disabled in OctoPrint's config.

.. _sec-api-printer-arbcommand:

Send an arbitrary command to the printer
========================================

.. http:post:: /api/printer/command

   Sends any command to the printer via the serial interface. Should be used with some care as some commands can interfere with
   or even stop a running print job.

   Expects a :ref:`Arbitrary Command Request <sec-api-printer-datamodel-arbcommand>` as the request's body.

   If successful returns a :http:statuscode:`204` and an empty body.

   **Example for sending a single command**

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/printer/command HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/json
      X-Api-Key: abcdef...

      {
        "command": "M106"
      }

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

   **Example for sending multiple commands**

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/printer/command HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/json
      X-Api-Key: abcdef...

      {
        "commands": [
          "M18",
          "M106 S0"
        ]
      }

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   
   :json string command:  Single command to send to the printer, mutually exclusive with ``commands``.
   :json string commands: List of commands to send to the printer, mutually exclusive with ``command``.
   :statuscode 204:       No error
