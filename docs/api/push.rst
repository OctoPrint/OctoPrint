Push updates

.. warning::

   The interface documented here is the status quo that might be changed while the interfaces are streamlined for
   a more general consumption. If you happen to want to develop against it, you should drop me an email to make sure I can give you a heads-up when
   something changes.

To enable real time information exchange between client and server, OctoPrint uses
`SockJS <https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-protocol>`_ to push
status updates, temperature changes etc to connected web interface instances.

Each pushed message consists of a simple JSON object that follows this basic structure:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   {
     "<type>": <payload>
   }

``type`` indicates the type of message being pushed to the client, the attached ``payload`` is message specific. The
following message types are currently available for usage by 3rd party clients:

  * ``connected``: Initial connection information, sent only right after establishing the socket connection. See
    :ref:`the payload data model <sec-api-push-datamodel-connected>`.
  * ``reauthRequired``: A reauthentication of the current login session is required. The ``reason`` parameter in the
    payload defines whether a full active login is necessary (values ``logout`` and ``removed``) or a simple passive
    login will suffice (all other values).
  * ``current``: Rate limited general state update, payload contains information about the printer's state, job progress,
    accumulated temperature points and log lines since last update. OctoPrint will send these updates when new information
    is available, but not more often than twice per second in order to not flood the client with messages (e.g.
    during printing). See :ref:`the payload data model <sec-api-push-datamodel-currentandhistory>`.
  * ``history``: Current state, temperature and log history, sent upon initial connect to get the client up to date. Same
    payload data model as ``current``, see :ref:`the payload data model <sec-api-push-datamodel-currentandhistory>`.
  * ``event``: Events triggered within OctoPrint, such as e.g. ``PrintFailed`` or ``MovieRenderDone``. Payload is the event
    type and payload, see :ref:`the payload data model <sec-api-push-datamodel-event>`. Sent when an event is triggered internally.
  * ``slicingProgress``: Progress updates from an active slicing background job, payload contains information about the
    model being sliced, the target file, the slicer being used and the progress as a percentage.
    See :ref:`the payload data model <sec-api-push-datamodel-slicingprogress>`.
  * ``plugin``: Messages generated by plugins. The payload data models are determined by the plugin which sent the
    message.

Clients must ignore any unknown messages.

The data model of the attached payloads is described further below.

OctoPrint's SockJS socket also accepts three commands from the client to the server.

  * ``subscribe`` (since 1.8.0): With the ``subscribe`` message, clients may selectively
    subscribe to certain message types. The payload should be a dict of message types with
    supported keys as follows:

    * ``state``: Either a boolean value indicating whether to generally receive state updates (``current`` and ``history``)
      or not, or a dict with further options for received state updates. Currently the following options are recognized here:

      * ``logs``: A boolean value whether to include all log lines (``True``, default) or not (``False``). Alternatively a string with
        a regex pattern can be provided, in which case only log lines matching the pattern will be returned.
      * ``messages``: Like ``logs`` but for the returned message lines.

    * ``plugins``: Either a boolean value indicating whether to generally receive plugin messages, or a list of plugin
      identifiers to receive plugin messages for.
    * ``events``: Either a boolean value indicating whether to generally receive event messages, or a list of event
      types to receive event messages for.

    If you send a ``subscribe`` message, OctoPrint will default the connection to not subscribe you to anything you did't explicitly
    request. ``subscribe`` messages do replace previous ones.

    Example for a ``subscribe`` message subscribing only to updates from plugin ``example`` but neither state nor events:

    .. sourcecode:: javascript

       {
         "subscribe": {
           "plugins": ["example"]
         }
       }

    Example for a ``subscribe`` message subscribing to state, event and plugin updates,
    but filtering logs in state updates to only contain lines matching ``^Recv: Cap`` and also
    filtering out all messages:

    .. sourcecode:: javascript

       {
         "subscribe": {
           "state": {
             "logs": "^Recv: Cap",
             "messages": false
           },
           "events": true,
           "plugins": true
         }
       }

    Example for a ``subscribe`` message subscribing only to events of type ``PrintFailed``:

    .. sourcecode:: javascript

       {
         "subscribe": {
           "events": ["PrintFailed"]
         }
       }

    .. note::

       Per default, OctoPrint will subscribe connecting clients to all state, event and plugin updates
       without any filtering in place. If you wish to have your more selective subscription active
       right from the start of your socket session, be sure to send the ``subscribe`` message
       **before** the ``auth`` message.

  * ``auth`` (since 1.3.10): With the ``auth`` message, clients may associate an
    existing user session with the socket. That is of special importance to receive
    any kind of messages, since the permission system will prevent any kind of status messages to be sent to connected
    clients lacking the ``STATUS`` permission.

    The ``auth`` message expects the user id of the user to authenticate followed by ``:`` and a session key to be
    obtained from the successful payload of a :ref:`(passive or active) login via the API <sec-api-general-login>`.

    Example for a ``auth`` client-server-message:

    .. sourcecode:: javascript

       {
         "auth": "someuser:LGZ0trf8By"
       }

    An example for an auth roundtrip with only an API key using the :ref:`JS Client Library <sec-jsclientlib-base>`
    can be found :ref:`here <sec-jsclient-socket-authsample>`.

    .. mermaid::

       sequenceDiagram
          participant Client
          participant API
          participant Websocket

          Client->>API: GET /api/login?passive=true&apikey=...
          API->>Client: { name: ..., session: ..., ... }

          note over Client: auth = name ":" session

          Client->>Websocket: { "auth": auth }

  * ``throttle``: Usually, OctoPrint will push the general state update
    in the ``current`` message twice per second. For some clients that might still
    be too fast, so they can signal a different factor to OctoPrint utilizing the
    ``throttle`` message. OctoPrint expects a single integer here which represents
    the multiplier for the base rate limit of one message every 500ms. A value of
    1 hence will produce the default behaviour of getting every update. A value of
    2 will set the rate limit to maximally one message every 1s, 3 to maximally one
    message every 1.5s and so on.

    Example for a ``throttle`` client-server-message:

    .. sourcecode:: javascript

       {
         "throttle": 2
       }
