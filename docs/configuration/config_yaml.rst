.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml:

config.yaml
===========

If not specified via the command line, the main configuration file ``config.yaml`` for OctoPrint is expected in its
settings folder, which unless defined differently via the command line is located at ``~/.octoprint`` on Linux, at
``%APPDATA%/OctoPrint`` on Windows and at ``~/Library/Application Support/OctoPrint`` on MacOS. If the file is not there,
you can just create it - it will only get created by OctoPrint once you save settings that deviate from the default
settings.

Note that many of these settings are available from the "Settings" menu in OctoPrint itself.

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-serial:

Serial
------

Use the following settings to configure the serial connection to the printer:

.. code-block:: yaml

   serial:
     # Use the following option to define the default serial port, defaults to unset (= AUTO)
     port: /dev/ttyACM0

     # Use the following option to define the default baudrate, defaults to unset (= AUTO)
     baudrate: 115200

     # Whether to automatically connect to the printer on server startup (if available)
     autoconnect: false

     # Whether to log whole communication to serial.log (warning: might decrease performance)
     log: false

     # Timeouts used for the serial connection to the printer, you might want to adjust these if you are
     # experiencing connection problems
     timeout:

       # Timeout for waiting for a response from the currently tested port during autodetect, in seconds.
       # Defaults to 0.5 sec
       detection: 0.5

       # Timeout for waiting to establish a connection with the selected port, in seconds.
       # Defaults to 2 sec
       connection: 2

       # Timeout during serial communication, in seconds.
       # Defaults to 5 sec
       communication: 5

     # Use this to define additional patterns to consider for serial port listing. Must be a valid
     # "glob" pattern (see http://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html). Defaults to not set.
     additionalPorts:
     - /dev/myPrinterSymlink

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-server:

Server
------

Use the following settings to configure the server:

.. code-block:: yaml

   server:
     # Use this option to define the host to which to bind the server, defaults to "0.0.0.0" (= all interfaces)
     host: 0.0.0.0

     # Use this option to define the port to which to bind the server, defaults to 5000
     port: 5000

     # Use this option to define an optional baseUrl (with a leading /, so absolute to your
     # server's root) under which to run OctoPrint. This should only be needed if you want to run
     # OctoPrint behind a reverse proxy under a different root endpoint than `/` and can't configure
     # said reverse proxy to send `X-Script-Name` and `X-Scheme` HTTP headers with
     # forwarded requests (see below). Defaults to an empty string and therefore the server root.
     baseUrl: /octoprint

     # Use this option to define an optional URL scheme under which to run OctoPrint.
     # Should only be needed for use with reverse proxies, see above.
     scheme: http

     # will be automatically set to false once the first-run-wizard has been completed
     firstRun: true

.. note::

   If you want to run OctoPrint behind a reverse proxy such as HAProxy or Nginx and use a different base URL than the
   server root ``/`` you have two options to achieve this. One approach is using the configuration settings ``baseUrl`` and
   ``scheme`` mentioned above in which OctoPrint will only work under the configured base URL.

   The second and better approach is to make your proxy send a couple of custom headers with each forwarded requests:

     * ``X-Script-Name``: should contain your custom baseUrl (absolute server path), e.g. ``/octoprint``
     * ``X-Scheme``: should contain your custom URL scheme to use (if different from ``http``), e.g. ``https``

   If you use these headers OctoPrint will work both via the reverse proxy as well as when called directly. Take a look
   `into OctoPrint's wiki <https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Reverse-proxy-configuration-examples>`_ for a couple
   of examples on how to configure this.

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-webcam:

Webcam
------

Use the following settings to configure webcam support:

.. code-block:: yaml

   webcam:
     # Use this option to enable display of a webcam stream in the UI, e.g. via MJPG-Streamer.
     # Webcam support will be disabled if not set
     stream: http://<stream host>:<stream port>/?action=stream

     # Use this option to enable timelapse support via snapshot, e.g. via MJPG-Streamer.
     # Timelapse support will be disabled if not set
     snapshot: http://<stream host>:<stream port>/?action=snapshot

     # Path to ffmpeg binary to use for creating timelapse recordings.
     # Timelapse support will be disabled if not set
     ffmpeg: /path/to/ffmpeg

     # The bitrate to use for rendering the timelapse video. This gets directly passed to ffmpeg.
     bitrate: 5000k

     # Whether to include a "created with OctoPrint" watermark in the generated timelapse movies
     watermark: true

     # The default timelapse settings.
     timelapse:

       # The timelapse type. Can be either "off", "zchange" or "timed". Defaults to "off"
       type: timed

       # Additional options depending on the timelapse type. Currently only the "timed" timelapse takes
       # the interval which to leave between images as option "interval", given in seconds. This example
       # therefore configures a "Timed" timelapse with an interval of 2s. Defaults to empty.
       options:
         interval: 2

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-feature:

Feature
-------

Use the following settings to enable or disable OctoPrint features:

.. code-block:: yaml

   feature:
     # Whether to enable the gcode viewer in the UI or not
     gCodeVisualizer: true

     # Whether to enable the temperature graph in the UI or not
     temperatureGraph: true

     # Specifies whether OctoPrint should wait for the start response from the printer before trying to send commands
     # during connect.
     waitForStartOnConnect: false

     # Specifies whether OctoPrint should send linenumber + checksum with every command. Needed for
     # successful communication with Repetier firmware
     alwaysSendChecksum: false

     # Whether to ignore the first ok after a resend response. Needed for successful communication with
     # Repetier firmware
     swallowOkAfterResend: false

     # Specifies whether support for SD printing and file management should be enabled
     sdSupport: true

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-folder:

Folder
------

Use the following settings to set custom paths for folders used by OctoPrint:

.. code-block:: yaml

   folder:
     # Absolute path where to store gcode uploads. Defaults to the uploads folder in the OctoPrint settings folder
     uploads: /path/to/upload/folder

     # Absolute path where to store finished timelapse recordings. Defaults to the timelapse folder in the OctoPrint
     # settings dir
     timelapse: /path/to/timelapse/folder

     # Absolute path where to store temporary timelapse files. Defaults to the timelapse/tmp folder in the OctoPrint
     # settings dir
     timelapse_tmp: /path/to/timelapse/tmp/folder

     # Absolute path where to store log files. Defaults to the logs folder in the OctoPrint settings dir
     logs: /path/to/logs/folder

     # Absolute path to the virtual printer's simulated SD card. Only useful for development, just ignore
     # it otherwise
     virtualSd: /path/to/virtualSd/folder

     # Absolute path to a folder being watched for new files which then get automatically
     # added to OctoPrint (and deleted from that folder). Can e.g. be used to define a folder which
     # can then be mounted from remote machines and used as local folder for quickly adding downloaded
     # and/or sliced objects to print in the future.
     watched: /path/to/watched/folder

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-temperature:

Temperature
-----------

Use the following settings to configure temperature profiles which will be displayed in the temperature tab:

.. code-block:: yaml

   temperature:
     profiles:
     - name: ABS
       extruder: 210
       bed: 100
     - name: PLA
       extruder: 180
       bed: 60

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-appearance:

Appearance
----------

Use the following settings to tweak OctoPrint's appearance a bit to better distinguish multiple instances/printers
appearance or to modify the order and presence of the various UI components:

.. code-block:: yaml

   appearance:
     # Use this to give your printer a name. It will be displayed in the title bar
     # (as "<Name> [OctoPrint]") and in the navigation bar (as "OctoPrint: <Name>")
     name: My Printer

     # Use this to color the navigation bar. Supported colors are red, orange,
     # yellow, green, blue, violet and default.
     color: default

     # Makes the color of the navigation bar "transparent". In case your printer uses
     # acrylic for its frame ;)
     colorTransparent: false

     # Configures the order and availability of the UI components
     components:

       # Defines the order of the components within their respective containers.
       #
       # If overridden by the user the resulting order for display will be calculated as
       # follows:
       #
       # - first all components as defined by the user
       # - then all enabled core components as define in the default order (see below)
       #
       # Components not contained within the default order (e.g. from plugins) will be either
       # prepended or appended to that result, depending on component type.
       #
       # Note that a component is not included in the order as defined by the user will still
       # be put into the container, according to the default order. To fully disable a
       # component, you'll need to add it to the container's disabled list further below.
       order:

         # order of navbar items
         navbar:
         - settings
         - systemmenu
         - login

         # order of sidebar items
         sidebar:
         - connection
         - state
         - files

         # order of tab items
         tab:
         - temperature
         - control
         - gcodeviewer
         - terminal
         - timelapse

         # order of settings, if settings plugins are registered gets extended internally by
         # section_plugins and all settings plugins
         settings
         - section_printer
         - serial
         - printerprofiles
         - temperatures
         - terminalfilters
         - gcodescripts
         - section_features
         - features
         - webcam
         - accesscontrol
         - api
         - section_octoprint
         - folders
         - appearance
         - logs

         # order of user settings
         usersettings:
         - access
         - interface

         # order of generic templates
         generic: []

     # Disabled components per container. If a component is included here it will not
     # be included in OctoPrint's UI at all. Note that this might mean that critical
     # functionality will not be available if no replacement is registered.
     disabled:
       navbar: [],
       sidebar: [],
       tab: [],
       settings: [],
       usersettings: [],
       generic: []

.. note::

   By modifying the ``components`` > ``order`` lists you may reorder OctoPrint's UI components as you like. You can also
   inject Plugins at another than their default location in their respective container by adding the entry
   ``plugin_<plugin identifier>`` where you want them to appear.

   Example: If you want the tab of the :ref:`Hello World Plugin <sec-plugins-gettingstarted>` to appear as the first tab
   in OctoPrint, you'd need to redefine ``components`` > ``order`` > ``tab`` by including something like this in your
   ``config.yaml``:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      appearance:
        components:
          order:
            tab:
            - plugin_helloworld

   OctoPrint will then turn this into the order ``plugin_helloworld``, ``temperature``, ``control``, ``gcodeviewer``,
   ``terminal``, ``timelapse`` plus any other plugins.

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-controls:

Controls
--------

Use the ``controls`` section to add :ref:`custom controls <sec-features-custom_controls>` to the "Controls" tab within
OctoPrint.

.. code-block:: yaml

   controls:
     - name: Fan
       layout: horizontal
       children:
         - name: Enable Fan
           type: parametric_command
           command: M106 S%(speed)s
           input:
             - name: Speed (0-255)
               parameter: speed
               default: 255
         - name: Disable Fan
           type: command
           command: M107

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-system:

System
------

Use the following settings to add custom system commands to the "System" dropdown within OctoPrint's top bar.

Commands consist of a name, an action identifier, the commandline to execute and an optional confirmation message to
display before actually executing the command (should be set to False if a confirmation dialog is not desired).

The following example defines a command for shutting down the system under Linux. It assumes that the user under which
OctoPrint is running is allowed to do this without password entry:

.. code-block:: yaml

   system:
     actions:
     - name: Shutdown
       action: shutdown
       command: sudo shutdown -h now
       confirm: You are about to shutdown the system.

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-accesscontrol:

Access Control
--------------

Use the following settings to enable access control:

.. code-block:: yaml

   accessControl:
     # whether to enable access control or not. Defaults to true
     enabled: true

     # The user manager implementation to use for accessing user information. Currently only a filebased
     # user manager is implemented which stores configured accounts in a YAML file (Default: users.yaml
     # in the default configuration folder, see below)
     userManager: octoprint.users.FilebasedUserManager

     # The YAML user file to use. If left out defaults to users.yaml in the default configuration folder.
     userFile: /path/to/users.yaml

     # If set to true, will automatically log on clients originating from any of the networks defined in
     # "localNetworks" as the user defined in "autologinAs". Defaults to false.
     autologinLocal: true

     # The name of the user to automatically log on clients originating from "localNetworks" as. Must
     # be the name of one of your configured users.
     autologinAs: someUser

     # A list of networks or IPs for which an automatic logon as the user defined in "autologinAs" will
     # take place. If available OctoPrint will evaluate the "X-Forwarded-For" HTTP header for determining
     # the client's IP address (see https://code.google.com/p/haproxy-docs/wiki/forwardfor on how to
     # configure the sending of this header in HAProxy). Defaults to 127.0.0.0/8 (so basically anything
     # originating from localhost).
     localNetworks:
     - 127.0.0.0/8
     - 192.168.1.0/24

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-events:

Events
------

Use the following settings to add shell/gcode commands to be executed on certain :ref:`events <sec-events>`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   events:
     subscriptions:
       # example event consumer that prints a message to the system log if the printer is disconnected
       - event: Disconnected
         command: "logger 'Printer got disconnected'"
         type: system

       # example event consumer that queries printer information from the firmware, prints a "Connected"
       # message to the LCD and homes the print head upon established printer connection, disabled though
       - event: Connected
         command: M115,M117 printer connected!,G28
         type: gcode
         enabled: False

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-terminalfilters:

Terminal Filters
----------------

Use the following settings to define a set of terminal filters to display in the terminal tab for filtering certain
lines from the display terminal log.

Use `Javascript regular expressions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions>`_:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # A list of filters to display in the terminal tab. Defaults to the filters shown below
   terminalFilters:
   - name: Suppress M105 requests/responses
     regex: '(Send: M105)|(Recv: ok T:)'
   - name: Suppress M27 requests/responses
     regex: '(Send: M27)|(Recv: SD printing byte)'

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-api:

API
---

Settings for the REST API:

.. code-block:: yaml

   api:
     # whether to enable the API
     enabled: True

     # current API key needed for accessing the API
     apikey: ...

.. _sec-configuration-config_yaml-devel:

Development settings
--------------------

The following settings are only relevant to you if you want to do OctoPrint development:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Settings only relevant for development
   devel:

     # Settings for the virtual printer
     virtualPrinter:

       # Whether to enable the virtual printer and include it in the list of available serial connections.
       # Defaults to false.
       enabled: true

       # Whether to send an additional "ok" after a resend request (like Repetier)
       okAfterResend: false

       # Whether to force checksums and line number in the communication (like Repetier), if set to true
       # printer will only accept commands that come with linenumber and checksum and throw an error for
       # lines that don't. Defaults to false
       forceChecksum: false

       # Whether to send "ok" responses with the line number that gets acknowledged by the "ok". Defaults
       # to false.
       okWithLinenumber: false
