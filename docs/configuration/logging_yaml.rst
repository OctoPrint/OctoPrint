logging.yaml
============

The logging configuration file ``logging.yaml`` for OctoPrint is expected in its settings folder, which unless defined
differently on the command line is located at ``~/.octoprint`` on Linux, at ``%APPDATA%/OctoPrint`` on Windows and at
``~/Library/Application Support/OctoPrint`` on MacOS.

You can use it to change the log levels of the individual components within OctoPrint, which might be necessary to help
in debugging issues you are experiencing, or to change the configuration of the logging handlers themselves, e.g. in
order to change size after which to rollover the ``serial.log``.

Changing log levels
-------------------

If you need to change the default logging level within OctoPrint, create the file with a text editor of your choice
(it's usually not there). The general format is this::

    logger:
      <component>:
        level: <loglevel>

with ``<component>`` being the internal OctoPrint component for which to change the loglevel, and ``<loglevel>`` being the
new log level to set. An example for increasing the log level of the events and the file management components to
``DEBUG`` (the highest amount of logging) would be this ``logging.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   logger:
     octoprint.events:
       level: DEBUG
     octoprint.filemanager:
       level: DEBUG

A list of important components for which an increase in logging might be interesting follows:

  * ``octoprint.events``: the event sub system
  * ``octoprint.filemanager``: the file management layer
  * ``octoprint.plugin``: the plugin sub system
  * ``octoprint.plugins.<plugin>``: the plugin ``<plugin>``, e.g. ``octoprint.plugins.discovery`` to change the log level of
    the `Discovery plugin <https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Discovery>`_ or ``octoprint.plugins.cura``
    to change the log level of the `Cura plugin <https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Cura>`_.
  * ``octoprint.slicing``: the slicing sub system

This list will be expanded when deemed necessary.

Changing logging handlers
-------------------------

You can also change the configuration of the logging handlers themselves, e.g. in order to make the ``serial.log`` larger
for debugging long running communications or to change the behaviour of the ``octoprint.log``.

You can find the default configurations of the ``file`` handler used for the ``octoprint.log``, the ``serialFile`` handler
used for the ``serial.log`` and the ``console`` handler used for the output to stdout in YAML format below:

.. code-block:: yaml

   handlers:
     # stdout
     console:
       class: logging.StreamHandler
       level: DEBUG
       formatter: simple
       stream: ext://sys.stdout

     # octoprint.log
     file:
       class: logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler
       level: DEBUG
       formatter: simple
       when: D
       backupCount: 1
       filename: /path/to/octoprints/logs/octoprint.log

     # serial.log
     serialFile:
       class: logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
       level: DEBUG
       formatter: simple
       maxBytes: 2097152 # 2 * 1024 * 1024 = 2 MB in bytes
       filename: /path/to/octoprints/logs/serial.log

You can find more information on the used logging handlers in the
`Python documentation on logging handlers <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.handlers.html>`_.

Changing logging formatters
---------------------------

The logging formatters can be defined via ``logging.yaml`` as well. The ``simple`` formatter as referenced above is
expressed in YAML as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

   formatters:
     simple:
       format: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"

The possible keys for the logging format can be found in the
`Python documentation on LogRecord attributes <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes>`_.
