Printer Safety Check
====================

The Printer Safety Check plugin comes bundled with OctoPrint starting with version 1.3.7.

It tries to identify printers or rather printer firmwares with known safety issues, such as
disabled thermal runaway protection, and displays a warning box to logged in users on
such identification.
