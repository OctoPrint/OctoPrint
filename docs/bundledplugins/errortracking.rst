Error Tracking Plugin
=====================

.. versionadded:: 1.3.11

The Error Tracking plugin will cause any logged exceptions in the server and the browser interface to be sent to
OctoPrint's `Sentry instance <https://sentry.io/>`_.

By enabling it you help to gather detailed information on the cause of bugs or other issues. This is especially
valuable on release candidates, which is why this plugin will also prompt you to enable error tracking if it detects
that you are subscribed to an RC release channel.

By default, even when enabled it will only be active if you are running a released OctoPrint version, so either a stable
release or a release candidate.

The Error Tracking plugin is using a Sentry instance kindly provided by `sentry.io <https://sentry.io/>`_. For information on their service
please refer to their `Security & Compliance documentation <https://sentry.io/security/>`_
and their `Privacy Policy <https://sentry.io/privacy/>`_.

The Error Tracking plugin has been bundled with OctoPrint since version 1.3.11.
