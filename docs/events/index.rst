.. note::

   With release of OctoPrint 1.1.0, the payload data has been harmonized, it is now a key-value-map for all events.
   Additionally, the format of the placeholders in both system command and gcode command triggers has been changed to
   accommodate for this new format. Last but not least, the way of specifying event hooks has changed, OctoPrint no longer
   separates hooks into two sections (gcodeCommandTrigger and systemCommandTrigger) but instead event hooks are now typed
   to indicate what to do with the command contained.

.. _sec-events-configuration:

Configuration
=============

Event hooks are configured via OctoPrint's configuration file ``config.yaml``. There they are contained in a
``subscriptions`` list located directly under the ``events`` node. The ``command`` node accepts either a single string
or a list of strings so that multiple commands can be executed in one go. Each hook carries an additional node type that
must be either ``gcode`` (for GCODE commands to be sent to the printer based on the event) or ``system`` (for commands to be
executed on the system OctoPrint is running on).

All event hooks can be disabled completely by setting ``event > enabled`` to ``false``. You can also disable individual
hooks by setting the (optional) node ``enabled`` to false, see the example below.

Example
-------

.. sourcecode:: yaml

   events:
     enabled: True
     subscriptions:
     - event: Disconnected
       command: python ~/growl.py -t mygrowlserver -d "Lost connection to printer" -a OctoPrint -i http://raspi/Octoprint_logo.png
       type: system
       enabled: false
     - event: PrintStarted
       command: python ~/growl.py -t mygrowlserver -d "Starting {file}" -a OctoPrint -i http://raspi/Octoprint_logo.png
       type: system
     - event: PrintDone
       command: python ~/growl.py -t mygrowlserver -d "Completed {file}" -a OctoPrint -i http://raspi/Octoprint_logo.png
       type: system
     - event: Connected
       command:
       - M115
       - M117 printer connected!
       - G28
       type: gcode

.. _sec-events-placeholders:

Placeholders
============

You can use the following generic placeholders in your event hooks:

  * ``{__currentZ}``: the current Z position of the head if known, -1 if not available
  * ``{__filename}``: filename of the currently selected file, "NO FILE" if not available
  * ``{__progress}``: the progress of the print in percent, 0 if not available
  * ``{__data}``: a string representation of the payload
  * ``{__now}``: the date and time of the event in ISO 8601

Additionally, all data from the payload can be accessed by its key. Example: If the payload happens to be defined
something like this:

  * ``file``: the file's name
  * ``origin``: the origin of the file, either ``local`` or ``sdcard``

then you'll be able to access the filename via the placeholder ``{file}`` and the origin via the placeholder ``{origin}``.

Available Events
================

Server
------

Startup
   The server has started

ClientOpened
   A client has connected to the web server.

   Payload:

     * ``remoteAddress``: the remote address (IP) of the client that connected

   **Note:** Name changed in version 1.1.0

ClientClosed
   A client has disconnected from the webserver

   Payload:

     * ``remoteAddress``: the remote address (IP) of the client that disconnected

Printer communication
---------------------

Connecting
   The server is attempting to connect to the printer.

Connected
   The server has connected to the printer.

   Payload:

     * ``port``: the connected serial port
     * ``baudrate``: the baud rate

Disconnecting
   The server is going to disconnect from the printer. Note that this
   event might not always be sent when the server and printer get disconnected
   from each other. Do not depend on this for critical life cycle management.

Disconnected
   The server has disconnected from the printer

Error
   An error has occurred in the printer communication.

   Payload:

     * ``error``: the error string

PrinterStateChanged
   The state of the printer changed.

   Payload:

     * ``state_id``: Id of the new state. See
       :func:`~octoprint.printer.PrinterInterface.get_state_id` for possible values.
     * ``state_string``: Text representation of the new state.

File handling
-------------

Upload
   A file has been uploaded.

   Payload:
     * ``file``: the file's name
     * ``target``: the target to which the file was uploaded, either ``local`` or ``sdcard``

UpdatedFiles
   A file list was modified.

   Payload:

     * ``type``: the type of file list that was modified. Currently only ``printables`` and ``gcode`` (DEPRECATED) are supported here.

       .. note::

          The type ``gcode`` has been renamed to ``printables`` with the introduction of a new file management layer that
          supports STL files as first class citizens as well. For reasons of backwards compatibility the ``UpdatedFiles``
          event for printable files will be fired twice, once with ``type`` set to ``gcode``, once set to ``printables``.
          Support for the ``gcode`` type will be removed in the next release after version 1.2.0.
