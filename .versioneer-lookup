# Configuration file for the versioneer lookup, manually mapping tags based on branches
#
# Format is
#
#   <branch-regex> <tag> <reference commit>
#
# The file is processed from top to bottom, the first matching line wins. If <tag> or <reference commit> are left out,
# the lookup table does not apply to the matched branches

# master, prerelease and rc shall not use the lookup table, only tags
master
prerelease
rc

# neither should disconnected checkouts, e.g. 'git checkout <tag>'
