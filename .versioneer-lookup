# Configuration file for the versioneer lookup, manually mapping tags based on branches
#
# Format is
#
#   <branch-regex> <tag> <reference commit>
#
# The file is processed from top to bottom, the first matching line wins. If <tag> or <reference commit> are left out,
# the lookup table does not apply to the matched branches

# master and staging shall not use the lookup table
master
staging

# fix/ branches are fixes for master, so we don't handle those either
fix/.*

# every other branch is a development branch and thus gets resolved to 1.2.0-dev for now
.* 1.2.0-dev 50cf776e70b9
