# Configuration file for the versioneer lookup, manually mapping tags based on branches

# The file is processed from top to bottom, the first matching line wins. If <tag> or <reference commit> are left out,
# the lookup table does not apply to the matched branches

# master, meta, rc and prerelease shall not use the lookup table, only tags
